    "description": " A wire discovered by Dean Hickerson in March 1997, using  his dr search program. It supports signals that travel through  the wire diagonally at two thirds of the speed of light.  Each 2c/3 signal is made up of two half-signals that can be  separated from each other by an arbitrary number of ticks.  Considerable effort has been spent on finding a way to turn a 2c/3  signal 90 or 180 degrees, since this would by one way to prove Life  to be omniperiodic. There is a known 2c/3 converter shown under  signal elbow, which converts a standard 2c/3 signal into a  double-length signal. This is usable in some situations, but  unfortunately it fails when its input is a double-length signal, so  it can't be used to complete a loop.  Noam Elkies discovered a glider synthesis of a reaction that can  repeatably insert a signal into the upper end of a 2c/3 wire. See  stable pseudo-Heisenburp for details. On 11 September 2017, Martin  Grant reduced the input reaction to five gliders, or three gliders  plus a Herschel. With the Herschel option the recovery time is  152 ticks.  See also 5c/9 wire.",

In terms of its minimum population of  58 cells it is the smallest known c/5 diagonal spaceship. It provides  sparks at its trailing edge which can perturb gliders, and this  property was used to create the first c/5 diagonal puffers. These  sparks also allow the attachment of tagalongs which was used to  create the first c/5 diagonal wickstretcher in January 2011.",

    "description": " A term used for negative spaceships travelling in  zebra stripes agar, perpendicular to the stripes, and also for  against-the-grain grey ships.  Below is a sample signal, found by Hartmut Holzwart in April  2006, that travels against the grain at 2c/3. This \"negative  spaceship\" travels upward and will quickly reach the edge of the  finite patch of stabilized agar shown here.  Holzwart proved in 2006 that 2c/3 is the maximum speed at which  signals can move non-destructively against the grain through zebra  stripes agar.",

After  the addition in 2016 of apgnano (native C++) and apgmera  (self-modifying, 256-bit SIMD compatibility), development continues  in 2017 with apgluxe (Larger Than Life and Generations rules, more  soup shapes). Several customized variants of the Python script have  also been created by other programmers, to perform types of searches  not supported by Goucher's original apgsearch 1.x.  All of these versions of the search utility work with a \"haul\" that  usually consists of many thousands or millions of random soup  patterns. Each soup is run to stability, and detailed object  census results are reported to Catagolue. For any rare objects  discovered in the ash, the source soup can be easily retrieved from  the Catagolue server.",

Instead, streams of gliders on two fixed opposing lanes collide  with each other to produce clean 90-degree output gliders. Slowing  down one of the streams by 8N ticks will move the output lanes of the  gliders toward the source of that stream by N full diagonals. This  construction method was used to create the supporting slow salvos in  the half-baked knightships, and also in the Parallel HBK gun.",

In some cases  the signals or sets of gliders can arrive in any order at all - i.e.,  they have non-overlapping effects.  However, in some cases such as slow salvo constructions, there is  a required order for some of the incoming signals. These signals can  still be referred to as \"asynchronous\" because the number of ticks  between them is infinitely adjustable: arbitrarily long delays can  be added with no change to the final result.

It can most  easily be connected to another B60 conduit, producing a closed loop,  the Simkin glider gun.",

    "description": "  A Spartan logic circuit discovered by Tanner  Jacobi on 12 May 2015. It converts an input glider signal into a  beehive, in such a way that the beehive can cleanly absorb a single  glider from a perpendicular glider stream. The circuit can't be  re-used until the beehive \"bit\" is cleared by the passage of at least  one perpendicular input.  This term has sometimes been used for the beehive catalyst  variant of SW-2, and also for Paul Callahan's larger  glider stopper, which also provides optional 0-degree and  180-degree glider outputs.",

Compare with Herschel, which appears  at generation 20 of the B-heptomino's evolution. B-heptominoes  acquired particular importance in 1996 due to Dave Buckingham's work  on B tracks. See in particular  My Experience with B-heptominos in Oscillators.  This pattern often arises with the cell at top left shifted one  space to the left, producing a seven-bit polyplet that shares the  same eight-bit descendant but is not technically a heptomino at all.  This alternate form is shown as the input for elementary  converter patterns such as BFx59H and BRx46B. This is standard  practice for elementary conduits, since many of these conduits do  in fact produce this alternate form as output.  The B-heptomino is considered a failed puffer or failed  spaceship, since on its own it travels at c/2 for only a short time  before being affected by its own trailing debris. However, it can be  stabilized into a c/2 puffer or into a clean c/2 rake or spaceship.  See, e.g., ecologist.",

A bi-block puffer is easily made using  two backrakes whose gliders impact symmetrically. Jason Summers  welded two backrakes to form a more compact puffer, as shown below.  By periodically burning the bi-block fuse using perturbations by a  following backrake and spaceships, c/2 rakes can be created for all  periods that are a multiple of eight.",

    "description": " A Spartan memory cell found by Paul Callahan in  1994. It can be in one of two states, containing either a boat or  a block. Input gliders on the appropriate paths can change the boat  to a block, or vice-versa, while also emitting an output glider.  Unlike many memory cells, attempts to change the state to the one it  is already in are ignored with the glider passing through with no  reaction. This makes it easy to reset the memory cell to a known  state. Which of the two states is considered the SET and which  considered the RESET is just a matter of convention.  The pattern below shows the \"boat\" state of the memory cell in its  original 1994 form. Two gliders are also shown to indicate the input  paths used to change the states. A smaller version is shown under  century eater, with the circuit in its \"block\" state.  As shown, the rightmost glider changes the state from a boat to a  block and emits a glider to the upper right, while the leftmost  glider passes through unchanged. Alternatively, when the state  contains a block, then the leftmost glider changes the state from a  block to a boat, and emits a glider to the lower right, while the  rightmost glider passes through unchanged.",

The  burning advances 12 cells every 18 generations.  Fuses can also be made with blinker rows which contain occasional two  cell gaps, since the burning reaction is able to bridge those gaps.",

The first such blinker  puffer was found by Robert Wainwright in 1984, and was unexpectedly  simple:  Since then many more blinker puffers have been found. The following  one was found by David Bell in 1992 when he was trying to extend an  x66:  The importance of this larger blinker puffer (and others like it), is  that the engine which produces the blinker output is only p4. The  blinker row produced by the puffer can easily be ignited, and the  resulting blinker fuse burns cleanly with a speed of 2c/3. When  the burning catches up to the engine, it causes a phase change in  the puffer. This fact allows p8 blinker puffers to be used to  construct rakes of all periods which are large multiples of four.",

The bit can be toggled by a glider travelling  along a certain path. A correctly timed glider on a crossing path  can detect whether the transition was from 1 to 0 (in which case the  crossing glider is deleted) or from 0 to 1 (in which case it passes  unharmed). Three gliders therefore suffice for a  non-destructive read. The mechanisms involved are shown in the  diagram below. Here the bit is shown in state 0. It is about to be  set to 1 and then switched back to 0 again. The first crossing  glider will survive, but the second will be destroyed.  In January 1997 David Bell found a method of reading the bit while  setting it to 0. A MWSS is fired at the boat-bit. If it is  already 0 (absent) then the MWSS passes unharmed, but if it is 1  (present) then the boat and the MWSS are destroyed and, with the help  of an eater1, converted into a glider which travels back along  exactly the same path that is used by the gliders that toggle the  boat-bit.  There are many other equivalent methods based on alternate incoming  test signals.",

The name is  taken from Lewis Carroll's _The Hunting of the Snark_, referring to  the fact that a small 90-degree stable reflector was really what was  wanted. 180-degree reflectors are relatively undesirable and have  limited use in larger circuitry constructions.  The boojum reflector was the smallest and fastest known stable  reflector until the discovery of the rectifier in 2009, followed by  the Snark in 2013.",

The term is also sometimes used to mean specifically the breeder  created by Bill Gosper's group at MIT, which was the first known  pattern exhibiting superlinear growth.  There are four common types of breeder, known as MMM, MMS, MSM and  SMM (where M=moving and S=stationary). Typically an MMM breeder is a  rake puffer, an MMS breeder is a puffer producing puffers which  produce stationary objects (still lifes and/or oscillators), an  MSM breeder is a gun puffer and an SMM breeder is a rake gun. There  are, however, less obvious variants of these types. Other less  common breeder categories (SSS, hybrid MSS/MSM, etc.) can be created  with some difficulty, based on universal constructor technology;  see Pianola breeder.  The original breeder was of type MSM (a p64 puffer puffing p30  glider guns). The known breeder with the smallest initial population  is switch-engine ping-pong.",

If the object being burned has a spatial periodicity, then the  active area of the burning usually remains bounded and so eventually  develops a periodicity too. It is unknown whether this will always  occur.  The speed of burning can range from arbitrarily slow up to the  speed of light. The results of burning can be clean (leaving no  debris), or leaving debris usually much different from the original  object. In rare cases, a reburnable fuse produces an exact copy of  the original object, allowing the creation of objects such as the  telegraph.  In many useful cases burning can be initiated by impacting an  object with gliders or other spaceships. An object might be able  to burn in more than one way, depending on how the burn is initiated.",

As the receding spaceship gets further away the bouncing spaceship  takes longer to complete each cycle, and so the extra spaceships  emitted by the reflector are produced at increasingly large  intervals. More precisely, if v is the speed of the bouncing  spaceship and u the speed of the receding spaceship, then each  interval is (v+u)/(v-u) times as long as the previous one. The  population at time t is therefore n.log(t)/log((v+u)/(v-u)) + O(1),  where n is the population of one of the extra spaceships (assumed  constant).  The first caber tosser was built by Dean Hickerson in May 1991.",

See  switch-engine ping-pong for the lowest-population  superlinear growth pattern as of July 2018, along with a list of  the record-holders.  The catacryst consists of three arks plus a glider-producing  switch engine. It produces a block-laying switch engine every  47616 generations. Each block-laying switch engine has only a finite  life, but the length of this life increases linearly with each new  switch engine, so that the pattern overall grows quadratically, as an  unusual type of MMS breeder.",

It gathers data from a distributed  search of random initial configurations and records the eventual  decay products. Within a year of operation it had completed a  census of the ash objects from over two trillion asymmetric 16x16  soups. As of June 2018, well over two hundred trillion ash objects  have been counted, from over a trillion asymmetric soups.  It is often possible to use Catagolue search results find  equivalent glider synthesis recipes for selected parts of  long-running active reactions. These random soup searches have  made it possible to find efficient construction methods for thousands  of increasingly rare still lifes and oscillators, and the  occasional puffer or spaceship. In many of these cases a  glider synthesis was previously very difficult or unknown.",

    "description": " A family of adjustable-speed spaceships constructed  by Michael Simkin in 2016, based on an \"engineless caterpillar\" idea  originally proposed by David Bell. The front and back halves of  Caterloopillars each function as universal constructors, with each  half constructing the building blocks of the other half, while also  reading and moving a construction tape. The overall design is  reminiscent of M.C. Escher's lithograph \"Drawing Hands\". The name  \"Caterloopillar\" is a reference to Douglas Hofstader's Strange Loop  concept.  Simkin has written an automated script that can construct a  Caterloopillar for any rational speed strictly less than c/4, with  some exceptions. Speeds closer to the c/4 limit in general require  larger constructions, and for any given computer system it is easy to  choose a speed that makes it impractical to construct a  Caterloopillar.  As of June 2018 one significant remaining exception is that  Caterloopillars with periods c/(6+4N) can't be constructed. This is  only a limitation of the current construction script, not of the  underlying Caterloopillar toolkit. For technical reasons, the  lowest speed that the current script can produce is around c/95. The  slowest Caterloopillars that have been explicitly constructed to date  are c/87 and c/92. These are among the smallest in terms of  population, though their bounding boxes are larger than some of the  higher-speed Caterloopillars.",

    "description": " A spaceship that works by laying tracks at its front  end. The first example constructed was a p270 17c/45 spaceship built  by Gabriel Nivasch in December 2004, based on work by himself, Jason  Summers and David Bell. This Caterpillar has a population of about  12 million in each generation and was put together by a computer  program that Nivasch wrote. At the time it was by far the largest  and most complex Life object ever constructed, and it is still one of  the largest in terms of population.  The 17c/45 Caterpillar is based on the following reaction between a  pi-heptomino and a blinker:  In this reaction, the pi moves forward 17 cells in the course of 45  generations, while the blinker moves back 6 cells and is rephased.  This reaction has been known for many years, but it was only in  September 2002 that David Bell suggested that it could be used to  build a 17c/45 spaceship, based on a reaction he had found in which  pi-heptominoes crawling along two rows of blinkers interact to emit a  glider every 45 generations. Similar glider-emitting interactions  were later found by Gabriel Nivasch and Jason Summers. The basic  idea of the spaceship design is that streams of gliders created in  this way can be used to construct fleets of standard spaceships  which convey gliders to the front of the blinker tracks, where they  can be used to build more blinkers.  A different Caterpillar may be possible based on the following  reaction, in which the pattern at top left reappears after 31  generations displaced by (13,1), having produced a new NW-travelling  glider. In this case the tracks would be waves of backward-moving  gliders.  For other Caterpillar-type constructions see Centipede,  waterbear, half-baked knightship, and Caterloopillar.",

It was discovered by Sergei Petrov on 1 July 2013, using a  custom-written search utility. It functions as a very compact  period doubler in some signal circuitry, for example the  linear propagator. The semi-Snark can period-double a regular  glider stream of period 51 or more, or an intermittent stream  with two gliders every 67 ticks or more, since the block reset glider  can be sent just 16 ticks before its partner.",

    "description": " A certain class of mathematical objects of which  Life is an example. A cellular automaton consists of a number of  things. First there is a positive integer n which is the dimension  of the cellular automaton. Then there is a finite set of states S,  with at least two members. A state for the whole cellular automaton  is obtained by assigning an element of S to each point of the  n-dimensional lattice Z^n (where Z is the set of all integers). The  points of Z^n are usually called cells. The cellular automaton also  has the concept of a neighbourhood. The neighbourhood N of the  origin is some finite (nonempty) subset of Z^n. The neighbourhood of  any other cell is obtained in the obvious way by translating that of  the origin. Finally there is a transition rule, which is a function  from S^N to S (that is to say, for each possible state of the  neighbourhood the transition rule specifies some cell state). The  state of the cellular automaton evolves in discrete time, with the  state of each cell at time t+1 being determined by the state of its  neighbourhood at time t, in accordance with the transition rule.  There are some variations on the above definition. It is common to  require that there be a quiescent state, that is, a state such that  if the whole universe is in that state at generation 0 then it will  remain so in generation 1. (In Life the OFF state is quiescent, but  the ON state is not.) Other variations allow spaces other than Z^n,  neighbourhoods that vary over space and/or time, probabilistic or  other non-deterministic transition rules, etc.  It is common for the neighbourhood of a cell to be the 3x...x3  (hyper)cube centred on that cell. (This includes those cases where  the neighbourhood might more naturally be thought of as a proper  subset of this cube.)  This is known as the Moore neighbourhood.",

This is in contrast to  many other Life-like rules, where even small objects can appear to  grow chaotically.  It is possible that chaotic growth may occur rarely or even  regularly for large enough random Life objects, but if so the minimum  size of such patterns must be larger than what can currently be  experimentally simulated (but see novelty generator).  In any case, it is not decidable whether a pattern that apparently  grows randomly forever is in fact displaying chaotic growth.  Continuing to evolve such a pattern might at any time result in it  suddenly cleaning itself up and becoming predictable.",

For example, an Fx119 inserter has an  unusually high 27hd clearance.  Also, oscillator and eater variants may be said to have better  clearance if they allow gliders or other signals to pass closer  to them than the standard variant allows. The following  high-clearance eater1 variant by Karel Suhajda allows gliders to  pass one lane closer on the southeast side, than is allowed by the  standard fishhook shape.  This is considered to be a variant of the eater1 because the  reaction's rotor is exactly the same, even though three cells in  this variant are too overpopulated to allow a birth, instead of  underpopulated as in a standard eater1 glider-eating reaction.",

This is the fifth or  sixth most common oscillator, being about as frequent as the  pentadecathlon, but much less frequent than the blinker, toad,  beacon or pulsar. It is surprisingly rare considering its small  size.  The protruding cells at the edges can perturb some reactions by  inhibiting the birth of a cell in a 3-cell corner. For example, a  clock can be used to suppress the surplus blinker produced by an  F171 conduit, significantly improving the recovery time of the  circuit:",

    "description": " A uniquely effective method of adding a glider to the  front edge of a salvo, by first constructing a clock, then  converting it to a glider using a one-bit spark. Here it rebuilds  a sabotaged glider in a deep pocket between other gliders:  In 2015 Chris Cain used this reaction to demonstrate conclusively  that any unidirectional glider salvo, no matter how large or  tightly packed, can be constructed by collisions between gliders that  are initially separated by any finite distance. As a corollary,  because all glider syntheses are made up of two to four  unidirectional salvos, any glider-constructible object has a  synthesis that starts with every glider at least N cells away from  every other glider (for any chosen N).",

    "description": " The colour of a glider is a property of the  glider that remains constant while the glider is moving along a  straight path, but that can be changed when the glider bounces off a  reflector. It is an important consideration when building  something using reflectors.  The colour of a glider can be defined as follows. First choose  some cell to be the origin. This cell is then considered to be  white, and all other cells to be black or white in a checkerboard  pattern. (So the cell with coordinates (m,n) is white if m+n is  even, and black otherwise.) Then the colour of a glider is the  colour of its leading cell when it is in a phase that can be rotated  to look like this:  A reflector that does not change the colour of gliders obviously  cannot be used to move a glider onto a path of different colour than  it started on. But a 90-degree reflector that does change the colour  of gliders is similarly limited, as the colour of the resulting  glider will depend only on the direction of the glider, no matter how  many reflectors are used. For maximum flexibility, therefore, both  types of reflector are required.  Small periodic colour-changing glider reflectors (bouncers) are  known, and also small periodic colour-preserving glider reflectors  (bumpers). Among stable patterns, only a small colour-preserving  reflector (Snark) is known. The smallest known 90-degree  colour-changing reflector is given at the end of the reflector  entry.",

  {
    "name": "construction elbow",
    "description": " One of the components of a construction arm in a  universal constructor. The elbow usually consists of a single  Spartan still life or small constellation. It accepts  elbow operation recipes, in the form of salvos coming from the  construction arm's shoulder.  These recipes may do one of several things: 1) pull the elbow  closer to the shoulder, 2) push the elbow farther from the  shoulder, 3) emit a glider on a particular output lane (while also  optionally pushing or pulling the elbow); 4) create a \"hand\" target  block or other useful object as a target for output gliders, to one  side of the construction lane; 5) duplicate the elbow, or 6)  destroy the elbow.  Elbows that receive and emit orthogonally-travelling spaceships  instead of gliders are technically possible, but no working examples  are currently known. The discussion below assumes that gliders are  used to communicate between the shoulder, elbow, and hand locations.  If a mechanism can be programmed to generate recipes for at least  the first three options listed above, it is generally capable of  functioning as a universal constructor. The main requirement is  that push and pull elbow operations should be available that are  either minimal (1fd) or the distances should be relatively prime.  Depending on the elbow operation library, there may be only one  type of elbow, or there may be two or more elbow objects, with  recipes that convert between them. The 9hd library had just one  elbow type, a block. The original 10hd library had two elbows,  blocks in mirror-symmetric locations; this was expanded to a larger  list for the 10hd Demonoid. The 0hd Demonoid also has a  multi-elbow recipe library. A slow elbow toolkit may make use of  an even larger number of glider output recipes, because the target  elbow object in that case is not restricted to a single diagonal  line.  If only one colour, parity, or phase of glider can be emitted, then  the mechanism will be limited to producing monochromatic salvos or  monoparity salvos. These are less efficient at most construction  tasks, but are still generally accepted to enable  universal toolkits. See also half-baked knightship.",

This term tends to be preferred when  either the input object or the output object is a spaceship.  The following diagram shows a p8 pi-heptomino-to-HWSS  converter. This was originally found by Dave Buckingham in a larger  form (using a figure-8 instead of the boat). The improvement  shown here is by Bill Gosper (August 1996). Dieter Leithner has  since found (much larger) oscillators of periods 44, 46 and 60 that  can be used instead of the Kok's galaxy.  For another periodic converter, see the glider-to-LWSS example in  queen bee shuttle pair. However, many converters are stable.  Examples of elementary conduit converters include BFx59H,  135-degree MWSS-to-G, and 45-degree MWSS-to-G.  The earliest and simplest stable converters known are shown below.  These are an HWSS-to-loaf, MWSS-to-beehive, and LWSS-to-blinker.  These can serve as memory cells, or as the first steps in  constructing objects using salvos.",

The first Cordership was constructed by Dean  Hickerson in April 1991, using 13 switch engines. He soon reduced  this to 10, and in August 1993 to 7. In July 1998 he reduced it to  6. In January 2004, Paul Tooke found the 3-engine glide symmetric  Cordership shown below.  At the end of 2017, Aidan F. Pierce discovered a clean  2-engine Cordership. There is also an adjustable-length 4-engine  Cordership found by Michael Simkin, made up of two identical or  mirror-image 2-engine components. The leading pair of switch engines  builds a block trail, which are then deleted by the trailing pair.  Corderships generate sparks which can perturb other objects in  many ways, especially gliders which can reach them from the side or  from behind. Some perturbations reflect gliders back the way they  came, and can be used for constructions such as the caber tosser  and the infinite glider hotel.",

It is made by replacing  one of the eaters in a Snark with a catalyst found using  Bellman. The catalyst causes the formation of a tub which  requires a second glider to delete. However, this adds 5 ticks to  the repeat time, so that it becomes 48. This is still 3 ticks faster  than the CC semi-Snark.",

A 0hd  Demonoid was completed by Chris Cain in December 2015, shortly after  a much larger 10hd version was constructed the previous month in  collaboration with Dave Greene. The 0hd spaceship fits in a bounding  box about 55,000 cells square, and displaces itself by 65 cells  diagonally every 438,852 generations.  The first 0hd Demonoid was fired by a gun. No spaceship gun  pattern had previously been completed before the first appearance of  the actual spaceship.  In June 2017 Dave Greene completed a much simpler single-channel  Demonoid using a temporary lossless elbow, which displaces itself  79 cells diagonally every 1,183,842 ticks. This was an improvement  in terms of design complexity, but not in terms of speed, population,  or bounding box. However, all of these could be further optimized.  A smaller Hashlife-friendly single-channel Demonoid design was  completed in 2018.",

If the  boat is present, a one-time turner reaction occurs and the glider  is turned 90 degrees onto a new lane.  If the Herschel and boat are removed from the above pattern, the  glider passes cleanly through the circuit. It can be used as the \"0\"  output of a one-bit memory cell, where the 90-degree output would  be the \"1\" output. This was the method used to store presence or  absence of neighbor metacells in the p1 megacell.",

    "description": " The density of a pattern is the limit of the proportion of  live cells in a (2n+1)x(2n+1) square centred on a particular cell as  n tends to infinity, when this limit exists. (Note that it does not  make any difference what cell is chosen as the centre cell. Also  note that if the pattern is finite then the density is zero.) There  are other definitions of density, but this one will do here.  In 1994 Noam Elkies proved that the maximum density of a stable  pattern is 1/2, which had been the conjectured value. See the paper  listed in the bibliography. Marcus Moore provided a simpler proof in  1995, and in fact proves that a still life with an m x n  bounding box has at most (mn+m+n)/2 cells.  But what is the maximum average density of an oscillating pattern?  The answer is conjectured to be 1/2 again, but this remains unproved.  The best upper bound so far obtained is 8/13 (Hartmut Holzwart,  September 1992).  The maximum possible density for a phase of an oscillating  pattern is also unknown. An example with a density of 3/4 is known  (see agar), but densities arbitrarily close to 1 may perhaps be  possible.",

    "name": "dependent conduit",
    "description": " A Herschel conduit in which the input Herschel  interacts with catalysts in the first few ticks. The standard  interaction actually starts at T=-3, before the Herschel is  completely formed. Compare independent conduit. The Herschel is  prevented from emitting its first natural glider. This is useful  in cases where the previous conduit cannot survive a first natural  glider emitted from its output Herschel.  This term is somewhat confusing, since it is actually the previous  conduit that depends on the dependent conduit to suppress the  problematic glider. Dependent conduits such as the F166 and  Lx200 do not actually depend on anything. They can be freely  connected to any other conduits that fit, as long as the output  Herschel evolves from its standard great-grandparent. As of this  writing, the Fx158 is the only known case where a conduit's output  Herschel has an alternate great-grandparent, which is incompatible  with dependent conduits' initial transparent block.",

    "name": "destructive read",
    "description": " The most common type of test reaction in  memory cell circuitry. Information is stored in a memory cell by  placing objects in known positions, or by changing the state of a  stable or periodic toggle circuit. A destructive-read test  consists of sending one or more signals to the memory cell. A  distinct output signal is produced for each possible state of the  memory cell, which is reset to a known \"zero\" or \"rest\" state. See  for example boat-bit, keeper, and demultiplexer.  To permanently store information in a destructive-read memory cell,  the output signal(s) must be used, in part, to send appropriate  signals back to the memory cell to restore its state to its previous  value. With output looped back to input, this larger composite  circuit then effectively becomes a non-destructive read memory  cell.",

Hickerson has found a number of components towards this end, but it  has proved difficult to change the direction of movement of a  drifter, and so far no complete track has been found. However,  Hickerson has had success using the same program to find eaters  with novel properties, such as sparking eaters and the ones shown  in diuresis.",

It is often modified in various  ways, or welded to other objects, to allow tighter packing of  circuits or to allow a signal stream to pass close by. See  clearance for an eater1 variant that is 1hd shorter to the  southeast than the standard fishhook form. An eater1 can also be  used as a 90-degree one-time turner.  Its ability to eat various objects was discovered by Bill Gosper in  1971. The fishhook eater can consume a glider, a LWSS, and a  MWSS as shown below. It is not able to consume an HWSS, however.  See honey bit or killer toads for that.",

    "description": "  This eater was found by Dave Buckingham in the 1970s.  Mostly it works like the ordinary eater1 but with two slight  differences that make it useful despite its size: it takes longer to  recover from each bite, and it can eat objects appearing at two  different positions.  The first property means that, among other things, it can eat a  glider in a position that would destroy an eater1. This novel  glider-eating action is occasionally of use in itself, and combined  with the symmetry means that an eater2 can eat gliders travelling  along four adjacent glider lanes, as shown below.  The following eater2 variant (Stephen Silver, May 1998) can be  useful for obtaining smaller bounding boxes. A more compact  variant with the same purpose can be seen under gliderless.",

    "description": "  A compound eater that can eat gliders coming from two  different directions. Also called the tub-with-tail eater (TWIT), it  is often placed along the edges of glider lanes to suppress  unwanted gliders in conduits. Below is the standard form, a compact  form with a long hook, and an often-useful conjoined form found  with Bellman. The sidesnagger is a Spartan constellation that  has a similar glider-absorbing function, using a loaf. See also  7x9 eater.  With gliders from either direction, the eater5's eating reaction  creates a spark that can be used to reflect other gliders. See the  example pattern in duoplet, or advance any of the topmost three  gliders in the above pattern by two ticks.",

    "name": "edge-repair spaceship",
    "description": " A spaceship which has an edge that possesses  no spark and yet is able to perturb things because of its ability  to repair certain types of damage to itself. The most useful  examples are the following two small p3 c/3 spaceships:  These were found by David Bell in 1992, but the usefulness of the  edge-repair property wasn't recognised until July 1997. The  following diagram (showing an edge-repair spaceship deleting a  Herschel) demonstrates the self-repairing action.  In October 2000, David Bell found that a T-tetromino component of a  c/4 spaceship can also be self-repairing. Stephen Silver noticed  that it could be used to delete beehives and, in November 2000, found  the smallest known c/4 spaceship with this edge-repair component - in  fact, two copies of the component:",

This is useful for  constructing complex guns. Compare glider pusher, which can in  fact be used for making edge shooters.  The following diagram shows a p46 edge shooter found by Paul  Callahan in June 1994.  Stable edge shooters became possible with the development of  Herschel circuitry. For example, NW31, BNE14T30, RNE-19T84,  and the high-clearance Fx119 inserter are often used in  shotguns for complex salvos. Composite edge-shooter circuits with  arbitrarily high clearance can be constructed.",

An early example still very  commonly used is Buckingham's BFx59H, which transforms a  B-heptomino into an inverted Herschel in 59 ticks. The BFx59H  elementary conduit is a component in many of the original universal  toolkit of Herschel conduits. An extension of the same naming  convention is used for elementary conduits, with the first and last  letters of the name specifying the input and output signal objects.  As with Herschels, an arbitrary orientation and center point is  chosen for each object. \"Fx\" means the signal moves forward and  produces a mirror-image output. See Herschel conduit for further  details.  Theoretically an elementary conduit may become a composite conduit,  if another conduit can be found that shares the beginning or end of  the conduit in question. In practice this happens only rarely,  because many of the most likely branch points have already been  identified: glider (G), LWSS (L) or MWSS (M), Herschel (H),  B-heptomino (B), R-pentomino (R), pi-heptomino (P),  queen bee shuttle (Q), century or bookend (C), dove (D), and  wing (W). A Herschel descendant might qualify, due to the  elementary conduit that can be seen in the p184 gun. However,  there are very few simple conduits that produce Herschel descendants  without Herschels, so in practice this is not a useful branch point.",

This was the first new Herschel conduit  discovery since 1998. After 171 ticks, it produces a Herschel at  (29, -17) relative to the input. A ghost Herschel in the pattern  below marks the output location:  The conduit's recovery time is 227 ticks, slower than many of the  original sixteen conduits because of the delayed destruction of a  temporary blinker, though the circuit itself is clearly Spartan.  The recovery time can be improved to 120 ticks by adding sparkers  of various periods to suppress the blinker. See clock for a  period-2 example.  The central eater in the group of three to the northwest can be  removed to release an additional glider output signal on a  transparent lane.",

The following  shows an example of a p144 gun which consists of a p144 block factory  whose output is converted into gliders by a p72 oscillator.  This gun is David Bell's improvement of the one Bill Gosper found in  July 1994. The p72 oscillator is by Robert Wainwright in 1990, and  the block factory is Achim's p144 minus one of its stabilizing  blocks. For a block factory using stable components and triggered by  an input Herschel, see also keeper.",

In the absence of the incoming LWSS the  gliders would simply annihilate one another, but as shown they allow  the LWSS to advance 11 spaces in the course of the next 6  generations.  The illusion of super-light-speed travel is caused by an LWSS that  is always created, but is then destroyed in some cases, by a signal  catching up to it from behind that necessarily never travels faster  than the speed of light. It is not possible to make any use of the  apparent super-light-speed signal. The front end of an output LWSS  can't be distinguished from the alternative dying spark output  until several more ticks have passed. Not surprisingly, this extra  time is enough to drop the average speed of information transmission  safely below c.  Leithner named the Fast Forward Force Field in honour of his  favourite science fiction writer, the physicist Robert L. Forward.  See also star gate and speed booster.",

All  small Life objects seem to eventually settle down into a mix of  oscillators, simple spaceships, and occasionally small puffers. See  methuselah, soup, ash.  Most sufficiently large random patterns are expected to grow  forever due to the production of switch engines at their boundary.  Engineered Life objects - and therefore also sufficiently large and  unlikely random patterns - can have more interesting behaviour, such  as breeders, sawtooths, and prime calculators.

    "description": " A protruding cell in an oscillator or dying spark, with  the ability to modify a nearby active reaction. Like a thumb, a  finger cell appears at the edge of a reaction envelope and is the  only live cell in its row or column. The finger spark remains alive  for two ticks before dying, whereas a thumb cell dies after one tick.  Because the key cell is kept alive for an extra tick, an alternate  technical term is \"held (orthogonal) bit spark\". A \"held diagonal  bit spark\" is not possible in B3/S23 for obvious reasons.",

The interaction between the  copperhead and the additional component is minimal enough that the  extension technically fits the definition of a tagalong. However,  the extension slightly modifies two of the phases of the spaceship,  starting two ticks after the phase shown below, so it's also valid to  classify the fireship as a distinct spaceship.",

    "description": " A reaction performed by a passing convoy of  spaceships which deletes a common stationary object without harming  the convoy. Fly-by deletion is often used in the construction of  puffers and spaceships to clean up unwanted debris.  For c/2 convoys this is not usually difficult since the LWSS,  MWSS, and HWSS spaceships have such useful sparks. However,  some objects are more difficult to delete. For example, deleting a  tub appears to require an unusual p4 spaceship.  The deletion of a pond appears to require a convoy which is 89  cells in width containing a very unusual p4 spaceship which has 273  cells. There are small objects which have no known fly-by deletion  reactions. However, as in the case of reanimation, hitting them  with the output of rakes is an effective brute force method.",

For example, a  \"freeze-dried salvo\" is a constellation of constructible objects  which, when triggered by a single glider, produces a unidirectional  glider salvo, and nothing else. Freeze-dried salvos can be useful  in slow salvo constructions, especially when an active circuit has  to destroy or reconstruct itself in a limited amount of time.  Gradual modification by a construction arm may be too slow, or the  circuit doing the construction may itself be the object that must be  modified.  The concept may be applied to other types of objects. For example,  one possible way to build a gun for a waterbear would be to program  a construction arm to build a freeze-dried waterbear seed, and then  trigger it when the construction is complete.",

    "description": " A frothing puffer (or a frothing spaceship) is a  puffer (or spaceship) whose back end appears to be unstable and  breaking apart, but which nonetheless survives. The exhaust  festers and clings to the back of the puffer/spaceship before  breaking off. The first known frothing puffers were c/2, and most  were found by slightly modifying the back ends of p2 spaceships. A  number of these have periods which are not a multiple of 4 (as with  some line puffers). Paul Tooke has also found c/3 frothing  puffers.  The following p78 c/2 frothing puffer was found by Paul Tooke in  April 2001.",

Useful fuses are usually clean, but see also  reburnable fuse.  A fuse can burn arbitrarily slowly, as demonstrated by the  example Blockic fuse below. A signal, alternating between  glider and MWSS form, travels up and down between two rows of  blocks in a series of one-time turner reactions. The spacing  shown here causes the fuse to burn 24 cells to the right every 240  generations, for a speed of c/10. Moving the bottom half further  from the top half by any even number of cells will slow down the  burning even further.",

The only known  higher-clearance edge shooters are injectors making use of multiple  interacting spaceships. This makes the Fx119 inserter ideal for the  construction of wide convoys whose total width can fit within its  clearance distance.  The component creates a large cloud of smoke behind its emitted  glider which lasts for over 90 generations. In spite of this, many  tightly packed convoys can be made by injecting later gliders behind  others in the convoy, helped along by the insertion reaction which is  able to catch up to the existing gliders. The Fx119 inserter can  place a glider on the same lane as a passing glider and as close as  15 ticks behind, which is only one step away from the minimum  possible following distance.",

After 77 ticks, it produces an inverted Herschel at (25, -8)  relative to the input. Its recovery time is 61 ticks; this can be  reduced slightly by suppressing the output Herschel's glider, as in  the L112 case. A pipsquirter can replace the blinker-suppressing  eater to produce an extra glider output. It is one of the simplest  known Spartan conduits, and one of the few elementary conduits in  the original set of sixteen.  In January 2016, Tanner Jacobi discovered a Spartan method of  extracting an extra glider output (top variant below). A  ghost Herschel marks the output location for each variant.",

    "description": " A configuration of ON and OFF cells that can only  occur in generation 0. (This term was first used in connection with  cellular automata by John W. Tukey, many years before Life.) It was  known from the start that there are Gardens of Eden in Life, because  of a theorem by Edward Moore that guarantees their existence in a  wide class of cellular automata. Explicit examples have since been  constructed, the first by Roger Banks, et al. at MIT in 1971. This  example was 9 x 33. In 1974 J. Hardouin-Duparc et al. at the  University of Bordeaux 1 produced a 6 x 122 example. The following  shows a 12 x 12 example found by Nicolay Beluchenko in February 2006,  based on a 13 x 12 one found by Achim Flammenkamp in June 2004.  Below is a 10x10 Garden of Eden found by Marijn Heule, Christiaan  Hartman, Kees Kwekkeboom, and Alain Noels in 2013 using SAT-solver  techniques. An exhaustive search of 90-degree rotationally symmetric  10x10 patterns was possible because the symmetry reduces the number  of unknown cells by a factor of four.  Steven Eker has since found several asymmetrical Gardens of Eden  that are slightly smaller than this in terms of bounding box area.  Patterns have also been found that have only Garden of Eden  parents. For related results see grandparent.",

It was  the thirteenth explicitly constructed spaceship velocity in Life, and  made possible an infinite family of related velocities. The Gemini  spaceship derives its name from the Latin \"gemini\", meaning twins,  describing its two identical halves, each of which contains three  Chapman-Greene construction arms. A tape of gliders continually  relays between the two halves, instructing each to delete its parent  and construct a daughter configuration.",

    "description": " A type of self-constructing circuitry that borrows key ideas  from Andrew Wade's Gemini spaceship, but with several  simplifications. The main feature common to the Gemini spaceship is  the construction recipe encoding method. Information is stored  directly, and much more efficiently, in the timings of moving  gliders, rather than in a static tape with 1s and 0s encoded by the  presence of small stationary objects.  Unlike the original Gemini, Geminoids have ambidextrous  construction arms, initially using glider pairs on two lanes  separated by 9hd, 10hd, or 0hd. The design was the basis for the  linear propagator and the Demonoids. A more recent development  is a Geminoid toolkit using a single-channel construction arm,  which allows for the possibility of multiple elbows with no loss of  efficiency, or the construction of temporary lossless elbows.  Compare slow elbow.  Other new developments that could be considered part of the  extended \"Geminoid\" toolkit include freeze-dried construction  salvos and seeds, used when objects must be built within a short time  window, and self-destruct circuits, which are used as an alternative  to a destructor arm to clean up temporary objects in a similarly  short window.",

The injected glider is synthesized  from one or more incoming spaceships assisted by the presence of  the GIG. (This contrasts with some other glider injection reactions  which do not require a GIG, as in inject.) Gliders already in the  glider stream pass through the GIG without interfering with it. A  GIG usually consists of a small number of oscillators.  For example, in July 1996 Dieter Leithner found the following  reaction which allows the construction of a pseudo-period 14 glider  stream. It uses two LWSS streams, a pentadecathlon and a  volcano.  Glider injection gates are useful for building glider guns with  pseudo-periods that are of the form nd, where n is a positive  integer, and d is a proper divisor of some convenient base gun period  (such as 30 or 46), with d > 13.",

This can be done by oscillators  or spaceships, or by Herschel conduits or other signal  circuitry such as the stable example shown under splitter. The  most useful glider duplicators are those with low periods.  The following period 30 glider duplicator demonstrates a simple  mechanism found by Dieter Leithner. The input glider stream comes in  from the upper left, and the output glider streams leave at the upper  and lower right. One of the output glider streams is inverted, so an  inverting reflector is required to complete the duplicator. To  produce non-parallel output, an inline inverter could be  substituted for the northmost p30 glider gun.  Spaceship convoys that can duplicate gliders are very useful  since they (along with glider turners) provide a means to clean up  many dirty puffers by duplicating and turning output gliders so as to  impact into the exhaust to clean it up.  Glider duplicators and turners are known for backward gliders using  p2 c/2 spaceships, and for forward gliders using p3 c/3 spaceships.  These are the most general duplicators for these speeds.",

True-period glider guns are known for some low periods, and for all  periods over 53 using Herschel conduit technology. See true  for a list of known true-period guns. The lowest true-period gun  possible is the p14 gun since that is the lowest possible period  for any glider stream, but no example has yet been found.  Pseudo-period glider guns are known for every period above 13.  These are made by using multiple true-period guns of some multiple of  the period, and glider injection methods to fill in the gaps.",

For a long time the only known  way to construct LWSS, MWSS and HWSS guns involved gliders, and  it was not until April 1996 that Dieter Leithner constructed the  first gliderless gun (a p46 LWSS gun).  In October 2017 Matthias Merzenich used two copies of  Tanner's p46 to create a p46 MWSS gun. This is the smallest known  gliderless gun, and also the smallest known MWSS gun.",

    "description": " Construction of an object by means of glider  collisions. It is generally assumed that the gliders should be  arranged so that they could come from infinity. That is, gliders  should not have had to pass through one another to achieve the  initial arrangement.  Glider syntheses for all still lifes and known oscillators with  at most 14 cells were found by Dave Buckingham. As of June 2018,  this limit has been increased to 18 cells.  Perhaps the most interesting glider syntheses are those of  spaceships, because these can be used to create corresponding  guns and rakes. Many of the c/2 spaceships that are based on  standard spaceships have been synthesized, mostly by Mark Niemiec.  In June 1998 Stephen Silver found syntheses for some of the  Corderships (although it was not until July 1999 that Jason Summers  used this to build a Cordership gun). In May 2000, Noam Elkies  suggested that a 2c/5 spaceship found by Tim Coe in May 1996 might be  a candidate for glider synthesis. Initial attempts to construct a  synthesis for this spaceship got fairly close, but it was only in  March 2003 that Summers and Elkies managed to find a way to perform  the crucial last step. Summers then used the new synthesis to build  a c/2 forward rake for the 2c/5 spaceship; this was the first example  in Life of a rake which fires spaceships that travel in the same  direction as the rake but more slowly.  A 3-glider synthesis of a pentadecathlon is shown in the diagram  below. This was found in April 1997 by Heinrich Koenig and came as a  surprise, as it was widely assumed that anything using just three  gliders would already be known.",

Glider turners are easily built using standard spaceships. The  following diagram shows a convoy which turns a forward glider 90  degrees, with the new glider also moving forwards.  Small rearrangements of the back two spaceships can alternatively  send the output glider into any of the other three directions.  See also glider duplicator and reflector.",

See switch-engine ping-pong for the lowest-population  superlinear growth pattern as of July 2018, along with a list of  the record-holders.  Collisions within the pattern cause it to sprout its Nth  switch engine at generation T = ~224n-6. The population of the  pattern at time t is asymptotically proportional to t times log(t),  so the growth rate is O(t ln(t)), faster than linear growth but  slower than quadratic growth.",

This was the first spaceship based on  this reaction, constructed in December 2014 by Adam P. Goucher. It  moves 6 cells horizontally and 3 cells vertically every 2621440+8N  ticks, depending on the relative spacing of the two halves. It is  one of the slowest known knightships, and the first one that was  not a Geminoid. Chris Cain optimized the design a few days later to  create the Parallel HBK.  The spaceship produces gliders from near-diagonal lines of  half-bakeries, which collide with each other at 180 degrees. These  collisions produce monochromatic salvos that gradually build and  trigger seeds, which in turn eventually construct small  synchronized salvos of gliders. These re-activate the lines of  half-bakeries, thus closing the cycle and moving the entire spaceship  obliquely by (6,3).",

    "description": " A Life algorithm by Bill Gosper that is designed to take  advantage of the considerable amount of repetitive behaviour in many  large patterns of interest. It provides a means of evolving  repetitive patterns millions (or even billions or trillions) of  generations further than normal Life algorithms can manage in a  reasonable amount of time.  The hashlife algorithm is described by Gosper in his paper listed  in the bibliography at the end of this lexicon. Roughly speaking,  the idea is to store subpatterns in a hash table so that the results  of their evolution do not need to be recomputed if they arise again  at some other place or time in the evolution of the full pattern.  This does, however, mean that complex patterns can require  substantial amounts of memory.  Tomas Rokicki and Andrew Trevorrow implemented Hashlife into  Golly in 2005. See also macrocell.",

    "description": " A pattern which can detect the passage of a  glider without affecting the glider's path or timing. The first  such device was constructed by David Bell in December 1992. The  term, coined by Bill Gosper, refers to the fact that Heisenberg's  Uncertainty Principle fails to apply in the Life universe. See also  stable pseudo-Heisenburp and natural Heisenburp.  The following is an example of the kind of reaction used at the  heart of a Heisenburp device. The glider at bottom right alters the  reaction of the other two gliders without itself being affected in  any way.",

However, in point of fact a Herschel bears no particular  resemblance to either of the symbols used for Uranus, but does  closely resemble the symbol for Saturn. So the appropriate name might  actually be \"Huygens\", but \"Herschel\" is now universally used by  tradition.  Herschels are one of the most versatile types of signal in stable  circuitry. R-pentominoes and B-heptominoes naturally evolve into  Herschels, and converters have also been found that change  pi-heptominoes and several other signal types into Herschels, and  vice versa.

    "name": "Herschel circuit",
    "description": " A series of Herschel conduits or other components,  connected by placing them so that the output Herschels from early  conduits become the input Herschels for later conduits. Often the  initial component is a converter accepting some other signal type  as input - usually a glider, in which case a syringe is most  commonly used. The Silver reflector is a well-known early  Spartan Herschel circuit from before the syringe was discovered,  where the initial converter is a Callahan G-to-H.  Sometimes a direct connection between two conduits is not possible  due to unwanted gliders that destroy required catalysts, or wanted  gliders that are not able to escape. In this case, small \"spacer\"  conduits such as F116, F117, Fx77, R64, L112, or L156 can  be inserted between the other conduits to solve the problem.  Some converter or factory conduits do not produce a Herschel as  output, instead generating other useful results such as gliders,  boats or MWSSes. See Herschel-to-glider, demultiplexer, and  H-to-MWSS respectively for examples of these. For those conduits  which do produce an unwanted Herschel, an eater such as SW-2 can  be added to delete it.  If the first and last conduits of a chain connect to each other in  a loop then there is no need for a syringe to generate the first  Herschel, or an eater to consume the last one. The circuit becomes a  self-supporting Herschel loop. A loop is also formed by a  syringe connected to a Herschel-to-glider converter, with the  glider reflected back to the syringe's input with glider reflectors  of the appropriate colour, usually Snarks. In either case, if the  loop has a surplus glider output, it becomes a gun; if no output  is available it is an emu.",

As of June 2018 the number is approximately 150, depending on  the precise definition of \"simple\" - e.g., fitting inside a 100x100  bounding box, and producing output in no more than 300 ticks. In  general a Herschel conduit can be called \"simple\" if its active  reaction does not return to a Herschel stage except at its output.  Compare elementary conduit, composite conduit. A description of  common usage in complex circuitry, using syringes and Snarks to  make compact connections, can be found in Herschel circuit.  The original universal set consisted of sixteen stable Herschel  conduits, discovered between 1995 and 1998 by Dave Buckingham (DJB)  and Paul Callahan (PBC). These are shown in the following table. In  this table, the number in \"name/steps\" is the number of ticks  needed to produce an output Herschel from the input Herschel. \"m\"  tells how the Herschel is moved (R = turned right, L = turned left, B  = turned back, F = unturned, f = flipped), and \"dx\" and \"dy\" give the  displacement of the centre cell of the Herschel (assumed to start in  the orientation shown above). ----------------------------------------- name/steps m  dx  dy  discovery ----------------------------------------- R64  R  11 9  DJB, Sep 1995 Fx77 Ff 25  -8  DJB, Aug 1996 L112 L  12 -33  DJB, Jul 1996 F116 F  32 1  PBC, Feb 1997 F117 F  40  -6  DJB, Jul 1996 Bx125  Bf -9 -17  PBC, Nov 1998 Fx119  Ff 20  14  DJB, Sep 1996 Fx153  Ff 48  -4  PBC, Feb 1997 L156 L  17 -41  DJB, Aug 1996 Fx158  Ff 27  -5  DJB, Jul 1996 F166 F  49 3  PBC, May 1997 Fx176  Ff 45 0  PBC, Oct 1997 R190 R  24  16  DJB, Jul 1996 Lx200  Lf 17 -40  PBC, Jun 1997 Rx202  Rf  7  32  DJB, May 1997 Bx222  Bf -6 -16  PBC, Oct 1998 -----------------------------------------  See also Herschel transceiver.",

Dependent conduit inputs are catalysed by a transparent block  before the Herschel's standard form can appear, and before the  Herschel's first natural glider is produced. This means that these  conduits will fail if an actual Herschel is placed in the \"correct\"  input location for a dependent conduit. Refer to F166 or Lx200  to see the correct relative placement of the standard transparent  block catalyst.

    "description": " A cyclic Herschel track. Although no loop of length  less than 120 generations has been constructed it is possible to make  oscillators of smaller periods by putting more than one Herschel in  a higher-period track. In this way oscillators, and in most cases  guns, of all periods from 54 onwards can now be constructed  (although the p55 case is a bit strange, shooting itself with gliders  in order to stabilize itself). A mechanism for a period-52 loop was  found in April 2018, but it includes a stage where the signal is  carried by a triplet of gliders so it may not be considered to be a  pure Herschel loop. The missing period, 53, is a difficult case  simply because 53 is prime and so no small sparkers or reflectors are  available.  See Simkin glider gun and p256 gun for the smallest known  Herschel loops. See also emu and omniperiodic.",

The signal is then converted to a Herschel by one of several known  mechanisms, the first of which was found by Dave Buckingham way back  in 1972. The second is elementary conduit RF48H, found by  Stephen Silver in October 1997.

The same ten signals are sent as in the original  telegraph and the p1 telegraph, but information is encoded more  efficiently in the timing of those signals. Specifically, the new  transmitter sends five bits every 960 ticks by adjusting the relative  timings inside each of the five mirror-image paired subunits of the  composite signal in the beehive-chain lightspeed wire fuse.",

A  competent highway robber does not affect gliders even on the lane  adjacent to the affected glider stream, except during its recovery  period.  A perfect highway robber doesn't affect later gliders even in the  lane to which it is attached, even during its recovery period. Below  is a near-perfect highway robber \"bait\" that requires three  synchronized signals to rebuild (the Herschel, B-heptomino, and  glider.) The glider at the top right passes by unharmed, but  another glider following on the same lane 200 ticks later will be  cleanly reflected to a new path, and another glider following that  one will also pass by unharmed. The only imperfection is a few ticks  at the very end of the reconstruction, as the beehive is being  rebuilt:",

    "description": " A block and pond constellation used in the  OTCA metapixel by Brice Due in 2006, to store and retrieve a bit of  data - specifically, the presence or absence of a neighbor  metacell. The \"0\" state of the honey bit memory unit is a simple  beehive, which is also the source of the name.  An input glider collides with the beehive to convert it into the  honey bit constellation, which can be thought of as a value of \"1\"  stored in the memory unit. A passing LWSS can then test for the  presence of the pond. If a collision occurs, the LWSS and the honey  bit constellation are mutually annihilated, leaving just the original  beehive. Below is the honeybit constellation with the two reactions  occurring in the opposite order - test, then reset.  If the pond is not present, the LWSS passes by the beehive without  affecting it. Thus a test input has an output for the \"0\" case, but  not for the \"1\" case. For an alternative memory-unit mechanism with  both \"0\" and \"1\" outputs, see demultiplexer.  The honey bit is also an interesting eater for the HWSS as  shown below. An HWSS colliding with the pond happens to create the  exact same reset glider used in the above memory unit.",

The key discovery was a very small but slightly dirty H-to-MWSS  conduit, where a Herschel is catalyzed to produce an MWSS but also  leaves behind a beehive. Prefixing two R64 conduits to this  produces a composite converter that successfully deletes the  beehive in advance, using the input Herschel's  first natural glider.  There are many other ways to remove the beehive using a spare glider  or additional conduits, but they are generally less compact than  this.",

For  examples, see puffer and glider turner.  Dave Buckingham found that the HWSS can be synthesized using three  gliders as shown below:",

In this pattern, two pairs of Corderships moving at c/12 are  pulling apart such that there is an ever-lengthening glider track  between them. Every 128 generations another glider is injected  into the glider track (see LWSS-glider bounce), joining the gliders  already circulating there. The number of gliders in the track  therefore increases without limit.  The tricky part of this construction is that even though all the  previously injected gliders are repeatedly flying through the  injection point, that point is guaranteed to be empty when it is time  for the next glider to be injected.",

    "name": "infinite growth",
    "description": " Growth of a finite pattern such that the population  tends to infinity, or at least is unbounded. Sometimes the term is  used for growth of something other than population (for example,  length), but here we will only consider infinite population growth.  The first known pattern with infinite growth in this sense was the  Gosper glider gun, created in a response to a $50 prize challenge  by John Conway. Martin Gardner's October 1970 article described the  challenge as \"Conway conjectures that no pattern can grow without  limit\", but Conway later explained that he had always expected that  this would be disproved. The original purpose in investigating CA  rules including B3/S23 was to show that a very simple two-state rule  could support a universal computer and/or universal constructor.  If all finite patterns could be proven to be bounded, neither of  these would be possible.  An interesting question is: What is the minimum population of a  pattern that exhibits infinite growth? In 1971 Charles Corderman  found that a switch engine could be stabilized by a pre-block in  a number of different ways, giving 11-cell patterns with infinite  growth. This record stood for more than quarter of a century until  Paul Callahan found, in November 1997, two 10-cell patterns with  infinite growth. The following month he found the one shown below,  which is much neater, being a single cluster. This produces a  stabilized switch engine of the block-laying type.  Nick Gotts and Paul Callahan showed in October 1997 that there is no  infinite growth pattern with fewer than 10 cells, so that question  has now been answered.  In October 2014, Michael Simkin discovered a three-glider collision  that produces a glider-producing stabilized switch engine and thus  produces infinite growth from the smallest possible number of gliders  (since all 71 2-glider collisions have a finite limit population).  Also of interest is the following pattern (again found by  Callahan), which is the only 5x5 pattern with infinite growth. This  too emits a block-laying switch engine.  Following a conjecture of Nick Gotts, Stephen Silver produced, in  May 1998, a pattern of width 1 which exhibits infinite growth. This  pattern was very large (12470x1 in the first version, reduced to  5447x1 the following day). In October 1998 Paul Callahan did an  exhaustive search, finding the smallest example, the 39x1 pattern  shown below. This produces two block-laying switch engines,  stability being achieved at generation 1483.  Larger patterns have since been constructed that display  quadratic growth.  Although the simplest infinite growth patterns grow at a rate that  is (asymptotically) linear, many other types of growth rate are  possible, quadratic growth (see also breeder) being the fastest.  Dean Hickerson has found many patterns with unusual growth rates,  such as sawtooths and a caber tosser. Another pattern with  superlinear but non-quadratic growth is Gotts dots.  See also Fermat prime calculator.",

For example, the output from a period 30 glider  gun where every third glider is deleted is an intermittent stream. A  pseudo-random glider generator can produce a complicated  intermittent stream with no obvious pattern.  Intermittent streams can be used to transmit signals, where holes  in the stream can also convey information. For example, the stream  can be processed by an inverter having the same period.",

A type 1 IMG consists of two guns firing at one another  in such a way that each gun is temporarily disabled on being hit by a  glider from the other gun. A type 2 IMG consists of a single gun  firing at a 180-degree glider reflector in such a way that  returning gliders temporarily disable the gun.  Both types of IMG can be used to make glider guns of periods that  are multiples of the base period. This is done by firing another gun  across the two-way intermittent stream of gliders in the IMG in  such a way that gliders only occasionally escape.",

The device  must be a gun whose period matches the base period of the stream,  since if there are no input spaceships then the device must produce  spaceships as the result of the inversion. Typically the spaceships  are gliders, and the inverter is made from a glider gun. Inverters  provide a way to produce a NOT logic operation on a stream.  There are several ways to produce an inverter. The simplest method  is to simply hit the output of a gun with the input stream to delete  its spaceships, producing an output stream that is always turned 90  degrees from the input stream. An example is the northernmost p30  gun in the glider duplicator example pattern. For one way to  produce an inverted output stream which is not turned, see  inline inverter.",

In the  original version Jaws had an initial population of 150, which at  the time was the smallest for any known pattern with  superlinear growth. In November 1997 Gotts produced a 130-cell  Jaws using some switch engine predecessors found by Paul  Callahan. See switch-engine ping-pong for the lowest-population  superlinear growth pattern as of July 2018, along with a list of the  record-holders.  Jaws consists of eight pairs of switch engines which produce a new  block-laying switch engine (plus masses of junk) every 10752  generations. It is therefore an MMS breeder.",

The first  Conway's Life knightship was a variant of Andrew Wade's Gemini  spaceship, constructed in May 2010. The next was an even slower  knightship based on the half-bakery reaction.  A knightship must be asymmetric and its period must be at least 6.  This is barely within the range of current search programs, as  proven by the discovery on March 6, 2018 of an elementary  knightship, Sir Robin, by Adam P. Goucher and Tomas Rokicki.  By analogy with the corresponding fairy chess pieces, spaceships of  types (3m,m)/n, (3m,2m)/n and (4m,m)/n would presumably be called  camelships, zebraships and giraffeships, respectively. Such  spaceships do exist (see universal constructor) but small  elementary versions are even more difficult to search for. Any of  these ship types could be constructed by trivially modifying a Gemini  spaceship, or less trivially by reprogramming one of the more recent  small Geminoid construction arms, but as of July 2018 a camelship  Gemini is the only example that has been explicitly built.  Alternatively, the term \"knightship\" is regularly used to refer to  any oblique spaceship, such as the original Gemini or the  waterbear.",

Occasionally diagonal lane measurements are given in  quarter-diagonals (qd), in part because diagonally symmetric  spaceships have a line of symmetry 1qd away from the lines available  for gliders. It's also convenient that moving a glider forward by  100qd (for example) has the same effect as evolving the same glider  for 100 ticks.",

Goucher with a period that is a Mersenne prime with 13,395 digits  (2^44497-1).  The next higher Mersenne-prime oscillator, period 2^86243-1, could  be constructed with quadri-Snarks and semi-Snarks. It would  actually be significantly smaller than the current record holder. As  of June 2018 the construction of this pattern has not yet been  completed.",

    "description": " A type of negative spaceship travelling through  the zebra stripes agar. The center of the bubble is simple empty  space, and the length and/or width of the bubble can usually be  extended to any desired size.  Below is a small stabilized section of agar containing a sample  lightspeed bubble, found by Gabriel Nivasch in August 1999. The  bubble travels to the left at the speed of light, so it will  eventually reach the edge of any finite patch and destroy itself and  its supporting agar.  An open problem related to lightspeed bubbles was whether large  extensible empty areas could be created whose length was not  proportional to the width (as it must be in the above case, due to  the tapering back edge). This was solved in February 2017 by Arie  Paap; a simple period-2 solution is shown below.",

These are potentially useful for various things, but so far the  necessary mechanisms are very large and unwieldy. In October 2002,  Jason Summers discovered a lightspeed reaction travelling through an  orthogonal chain of beehives. Summers completed a period-1440  lightspeed telegraph based on this reaction in 2003.  A stable lightspeed transceiver mechanism using this same  signal reaction, the p1 telegraph, was constructed by Adam P.  Goucher in 2010; the bounding boxes of both the transmitter and  receiver are over 5000 cells on a side. A more compact periodic  high-bandwidth telegraph with a much improved transmission rate was  completed by Louis-Francois Handfield in 2017.  The following diagram shows an older example of a lightspeed wire,  with a small defect that travels along it at the speed of light. As  of June 2018, no method has been found of creating such a defect in  the upstream end of this particular stable wire, or of  non-destructively detecting the arrival of the defect and repairing  the wire at the downstream end.",

An input glider can arrive at any multiple of 44160 generations to  first cut the line, then send a glider through the gap, and finally  mend the line while leaving an output glider on the other side.  A line crosser whose complete mechanism is on one side of the line  is theoretically possible, using single-channel construction  methods for example.",

See  the line cutting reaction for a way of creating the gliders  travelling parallel to the line.  This reaction uses spaceships on both sides of the line which need  to be synchronized to each other, for example by passing a glider  through the gap to trigger the creation of the required spaceships  and gliders.  No simple mechanism is known to mend the gap which lies completely  on one side of the line. However, it is technically possible to use  construction arm technology to push objects through the gap to  build and trigger a seed for the required synchronized signals  on the other side.",

    "description": " A puffer which produces its output by means of an  orthogonal line of cells at right angles to the direction of travel.  The archetypal line puffer was found by Alan Hensel in March 1994,  based on a spaceship found earlier that month by Hartmut Holzwart.  The following month Holzwart found a way to make extensible c/2  line puffers, and Hensel found a much smaller stabilization the  following day. But in October 1995 Tim Coe discovered that for large  widths these were often unstable, although typically lasting millions  of generations. In May 1996, however, Coe found a way to fix the  instability. The resulting puffers appear to be completely stable  and to exhibit an exponential increase in period as a function of  width, although neither of these things has been proved.  Line puffers have enabled the construction of various difficult  periods for c/2 spaceships and puffers, including occasionally  periods which are not multiples of 4 and which would therefore be  impossible to attain with the usual type of construction based on  standard spaceships. (See frothing puffer for another method of  constructing such periods.) In particular, the first c/2 rake with  period not divisible by 4 was achieved in January 2000 when David  Bell constructed a p42 backrake by means of line puffers.  See also hivenudger and puff suppressor.",

It is theoretically  possible to construct lossless elbows for early construction arms  such as the one in the 10hd Demonoid, but these would currently  have to be very large.  The lossless elbow that has been used the most in practice is the  Snark, which can be constructed directly on a single-channel  construction lane using a Snarkmaker recipe. Controlled  demolition of a Snark is also possible, to remove a temporary elbow  that is no longer needed, and leave a hand target in its place if  necessary for further construction.  A Silver reflector was used as a lossless elbow in the first  spiral growth pattern, attached to a separate  universal constructor component.",

The spaceship can also perturb  some objects in additional ways. For examples, see blinker ship,  hivenudger, and puffer train.  Dave Buckingham found that the LWSS can be synthesized in several  different ways using three gliders, and can be constructed from two  gliders and another small object in several more ways.

    "name": "macrocell",
    "description": " A format used by Golly and its hashlife algorithm,  capable of storing repetitive patterns very efficiently, even if they  contain a large number of cells. For example, a filled square 2^167  cells on a side can be stored in less than three kilobytes in  macrocell format, or about 800 bytes in compressed macrocell format.  The square's total population is over a googol, 10^100; the number of  atoms in the observable universe is only about 10^80.  This high level of compression is obtained by defining a tree  structure composed of increasingly large cell \"tiles\" with  power-of-two dimensions. Tile definitions of any size are re-used  whenever they appear multiple times in a large pattern (at the same  power-of-two offset). For example, the following is a macrocell  encoding of a complex pseudo still life arrangement of ships,  with a total population over 2500 cells: [M2] (golly 3.0) #R B3/S23 .**.**$*.*.*.*$**...**$$**...**$*.*.*.*$.**.**$ 4 0 1 1 1 5 2 0 2 2 6 3 3 0 3 7 4 4 4 4  The first line after the #R rule line defines a quadtree tile at  the lowest level - a level-3 tile in this case, meaning a 2^3 square  area. At this level the pattern is encoded in a modified ASCII  format with dollar signs as line separators. The next line, #2,  defines a level-4 quadtree tile, made from one empty level-3 tile in  the northwest corner (0), and three copies of the level-3 tile that  was defined on the previous line (1). Lines 3, 4, and 5 similarly  define level 5, 6, and 7 quadtree tiles by giving the line numbers of  four tiles of the next lower size.  Many patterns are only moderately repetitive, so macrocell format  is somewhat less successful at compressing them. Certainly most  patterns are not nearly as regular as the artificial example above:  there are usually many different tiles defined at each level, not  just one. Chaotic patterns, such as ash from random soups,  usually need so many different tile definitions that they can be  stored more efficiently using rle format.",

See for example  demultiplexer, honey bit, and boat-bit. Depending on the  application, the circuit may be a toggle circuit or a  permanent switch, or it may be possible to send one or more signals  to set the circuit to a \"1\" state, as can be done with a keeper  mechanism. In that case a different input signal must be used to  test the current state, usually with a destructive read reaction.  A more complicated example can be found in the Osqrtlogt pattern,  which destructively reads a growing 2-dimensional array of minimal  memory cells. Each memory cell may either contain a boat (below  left) or empty space (below right), with no permanent circuitry  anywhere near:  The two beehives and the block are placed by slow salvos, after  an initial 90-degree 2-glider collision that produces a target  honey farm. The beehive constellation acts as a one-time  turner for an incoming glider. If the boat is present, it acts  as a second one-time turner for that glider, sending back a \"1\"  signal. The \"backstop\" block in the northeast is destroyed cleanly  in either the \"0\" or the \"1\" case.",

For examples see  blinker puffer and glider turner.  Dave Buckingham found that the MWSS can be synthesized using three  gliders, and can be constructed from two gliders and another small  object in several more ways. Here is the glider synthesis:",

It has not been proven conclusively that any particular pattern is  in fact an infinite novelty generator, since it is always possible  that periodicity will spontaneously arise if the simulation is  continued far enough. In fact this happens quite regularly. But  conversely, it has not been proven that periodicity must  spontaneously arise for all such patterns.

    "description": " One of the most common stable edge shooters. This  Herschel-to-glider converter suppresses the junk ordinarily left  behind by an evolving Herschel while allowing both the  first natural glider and second natural glider to escape on  transparent lanes:  The edge shooter output at the top has no additional clearance, so  its use in creating convoys is limited: it can only add gliders on  the outermost lanes of an existing glider salvo. Like the beehive  version of SW-2, either output can be used to build logical OR  gates, where multiple input signal paths are merged onto the same  output path.  The complete name for this converter is \"NW31T120\", where 31 is the  output glider lane number. In the above orientation, lane numbers  get bigger toward the upper right and smaller toward the lower left  (and may easily be negative).  The T120 timing measurement means that a canonical NW glider placed  on lane 31 at time T=120, at (+31, +0) relative to the input  Herschel, would in theory reach the exact same spacetime locations as  the converter's output glider does.  Most converters are not edge shooters and their output lanes are  not transparent, so they usually have catalysts that would interfere  with this theoretically equivalent glider. This is the case for the  optional third glider output created by the lower eater1 catalyst:  the upper eater1 overlaps its lane. For the alternate block  catalyst suppressing this glider output, see transparent lane.",

As of June 2018, no oscillators are known for periods 19,  23, 38, or 41. If we insist that the oscillator must be  non-trivial, then 34 should be added to this list.  Note that if we were to allow infinite oscillators, then all  periods are certainly possible, as any period of 14 or more can be  obtained using a glider (or LWSS) stream, or an infinitely long  2c/3 wire containing signals with the desired separation.",

The first example was completed by Dave Greene  on 29 June 2017, with a top speed of 16c/217251 (this is just  256c/3476016 in lowest terms).  The construction recipe is a stream of MWSSes, with the recovery  time limited to 90 ticks by the Lx200 dependent conduit that  follows the initial syringe converter. The design is  hashlife-friendly, meaning that the spaceship can be trivially  adjusted so that spatial and temporal offsets are exact powers of  two; period 4194304 and period 8388608 versions have been  constructed, with speeds of c/16384 and c/32768 respectively.  The MWSSes are converted to Herschels, which produce a standard  single-channel glider stream that runs the Orthogonoid's single  construction arm. After the child circuitry is complete, a  previously constructed Snark in the parent is removed from the  construction arm lane, converting it to a \"destruction arm\" that  shoots down the previous constructor/reflector in the series.",

    "name": "oscillator",
    "description": " Any pattern that is a predecessor of itself. The term  is usually restricted to non-stable finite patterns; period 1  oscillators are stable and are usually just called still lifes.  The blinker is the smallest non-stable oscillator, having period 2.  There are oscillators of almost all higher periods (see  omniperiodic). In general cellular automaton theory the term  \"oscillator\" usually covers spaceships as well, but this usage is  not normal in Life.  Oscillators consisting of separate objects which do not react in  any phase are usually ignored. For example, a separated blinker  and pulsar makes a period 6 oscillator, but is considered  trivial.  An oscillator can be divided into a rotor and a stator, and the  stator can be further subdivided into bushing and casing. Some  oscillators have no casing cells, and a few 100%-volatility  oscillators also have no bushing cells.  An oscillator can be constructed from any gun as long as eaters  can be added to consume its output. If it is a true gun then the  period of the oscillator will be the same as the gun - unless the  eating mechanism multiplies the period, as in the case of gliders  caught by a boat-bit.  With the discovery of reflectors, relays provide an easy way to  create oscillators of all large periods. For example, eight gliders  travelling in a loop created by four Snarks can create any period  above 42, with a population never exceeding 356 live cells.  For the very lowest periods, whole families of extensible  oscillators are known. Examples of this are barberpole, cross,  pentoad, p6 shuttle, snacker, and multiple roteightors. Any  of the shuttles are oscillators by definition, for example the  queen bee shuttle. Many of these are also extensible. Other  oscillators such as figure-8 and tumbler have unique mechanisms  that are not part of an extended family.  Some oscillators are useful because of the perturbations they can  cause to other objects. This is especially true if they provide a  spark on their boundary. Some oscillators are explicitly found by  search programs in order to produce these sparks, such as  pipsquirters.  Some higher period oscillators have been found while running random  soups. This is especially true if the soup is run on a cylindrical  or torus universe. Sometimes the found objects can be moved to the  normal universe and supported there by added catalysts.  Achim's p144 is an example.",

The population returns infinitely often to its initial  minimum value (during carry operations from 11111...1 to 100000...0,  so it can be considered to be an unusual form of sawtooth.",

A  Silver reflector has a recovery time of 497 ticks, but can be  overclocked to reflect a period 250 glider stream, or any nearby  period above 248, simply by removing a beehive after the first glider  enters the reflector. However, a continuous stream of gliders is  then required to maintain the circuit, with timing within a tightly  bounded range.",

To be a good candidate for building  one of these types of patterns with a new period or speed, a  stationary reaction (for a gun) or a moving reaction (for a  macro-spaceship) must be able to produce some number of output  signals, strictly greater than the number of input signals required  to maintain the reaction. The extra signal becomes a gun's output  stream, or may be used in a variety of ways to construct the  supporting track for a macro-spaceship. By implication,  \"over-unity\" refers to the ratio of output signals to input signals.  If all signal outputs must be used up to sustain a stationary  reaction, a high-period oscillator may still be possible. See  emu for example.",

There is no known true-period p14 glider gun, and  finding a small direct example is well beyond current search  algorithms' abilities. However, pseudo-period p14 guns have been  created by injecting gliders into a higher period glider stream.  The first pseudo p14 gun was built by Dieter Leithner in 1995.  Smaller pseudo p14 guns have since been constructed, but they are  still much too large to show here. The essential mechanism used by  them is demonstrated in GIG.",

A single incoming glider produces the entire ten-part  composite lightspeed signal that restores the beehive-chain  lightspeed wire to its original position. The signal is detected  at the other end of the telegraph and converted back into a single  output signal. This simplification came at the cost of a much slower  transmission speed, one bit per 91080 ticks. In this mechanism,  sending the entire ten-part signal constitutes a '1' bit, and not  sending the signal means '0'. See also high-bandwidth telegraph.",

It uses four R64 conduits to  make the second smallest known Herschel loop (after the  Simkin glider gun). The p256 gun was an early \"teaser\" from Dave  Buckingham before he released his full Herschel technology.  Either eaters or snakes can be added as shown above, to suppress  three of the glider streams so that only one stream escapes. This  gun's p256 glider stream is well-suited for repeated reactions with  receding Corderships, or for \"Hashlife-friendly\" signal  circuitry.",

All known p30 glider guns are  made from two or more interacting queen bee shuttles. Paul Callahan  found 30 different ways that three queen bee shuttles can react to  form a period 30 glider gun. One of the most interesting of these is  shown below in which the gliders emerge in an unexpected direction.",

For bounding box optimization purposes, it's also possible to  replace the eater1 in a p3, p6 or p9 bumper with another period 3  oscillator, saving one row along the south edge at the cost of a  higher population.  The repeat time for all these variants is 36 ticks, as shown.",

In 1996 he found a  gun which only used one copy of the oscillator. Paul Callahan  improved it in 1997, resulting in the gun shown below:",

    "name": "p44 MWSS gun",
    "description": " A gun discovered by Dieter Leithner in April 1997, in a  somewhat larger form. This was the smallest known gliderless gun and  smallest known MWSS gun until the construction in 2017 of the gun  shown under gliderless, based on Tanner's p46.  The p44 MWSS gun is based on a p44 oscillator discovered by Dave  Buckingham in early 1992, shown here in an improved form found in  January 2005 by Jason Summers using a new p4 sparker by Nicolay  Beluchenko. A glider shape appears in this gun for three consecutive  generations, but always as part of a larger cluster, so even a  purist would regard this gun as gliderless.",

Prior to the discovery of  Tanner's p46 in October 2017, all known p46 guns were made from two  or more twin bees shuttles that interact (e.g., see  twin bees shuttle pair). See edge shooter and double-barrelled  for two more of these.  On 21 October 2017 Heinrich Koenig found a glider gun using two  copies of Tanner's p46 placed at right angles to each other. This  is the first p46 gun found which makes no use of the  twin bees shuttle.  See gliderless for a MWSS gun also made using two copies of  Tanner's p46.",

Many different p92 guns are known that use multiple  twin bees shuttles. A period 92 gun can also be made by adding a  semi-cenark to any period 46 glider gun.  On 18 November 2017, Martin Grant found a new gun using one twin  bees shuttle and one Tanner's p46 oscillator, making it the  smallest known p92 gun.",

A glider  striking a P2 constellation will generally produce a different result  depending on its parity. Period-4 intermediate targets are rare (or  not used), so it doesn't matter for example whether an odd-parity  glider in a slow salvo is phase 1 or phase 3. Only the even/odd  parity is important.",

Running a partial result works for a few generations until the  speed of light corruption from any unfinished edge destroys the  whole object. But a partial result can still be used to see whether  the object (if ever finished) would provide a desired spark or  perturbation. If no partial results are found then it is likely  that no such object exists under the constraints of the search.  Very large partial results can indicate that there is a good chance  that the object being searched for might actually exist (but this is  no guarantee). Rerunning the search using the partial result as a  base and relaxing some constraints, widening or adjusting the search  area, or splitting the object into multiple arms might result in  finding a complete working object.  As an example, here is a large partial result for a period 6  knightship found by Josh Ball in April 2017. The first 22 columns  were rediscovered in 2018 as part of the successful search for  Sir Robin. See also almost knightship for an earlier small  example by Eugene Langvagen.",

In fact it  is the fifth most common oscillator overall, appearing in random  soups slightly more frequently than the clock, but much less  frequently than the blinker, toad, beacon or pulsar. The  pentadecathlon can be constructed using just three gliders, as shown  in glider synthesis.  The pentadecathlon is the only known oscillator that has two  phases that are different polyominoes. It produces accessible  V sparks and domino sparks, which give it a great capacity for  doing perturbations, especially for period 30 based technology.  See relay for example.",

In a periodic intermittent stream there  may be gaps, so that signals do not always appear at every nth tick.

The term \"period multiplier\" can be  somewhat misleading in this context, because most such circuits can  accept input streams that are not strictly periodic.  Reactions have also been found to period double or period triple  the output of some rakes to create high-period rakes in a  relatively small space (i.e., an exponential increase in period for a  linear increase in size).  For Herschel signals and glider guns, a number of small period  doubler, tripler, and quadrupler mechanisms are known. For example,  the following conduit produces one output glider after accepting  four input B-heptominoes, or four Herschels if a conduit such as  F117 is prepended that includes the same BFx59H converter.  See semi-Snark and tremi-Snark for additional examples using  glider streams. As of June 2018 no stable period-multiplying  elementary conduits are known for a multiplication factor of five  or higher, though it is easy to construct composite ones.",

If the  perturbation is repeated indefinitely, this can effectively change  the period of the object. An example of this, found by Dean  Hickerson in November 1998, is shown below. In this example, the  period of the oscillator would be 7 if the mold were removed, but  the period is increased to 8 because of the repeated phase changes  caused by the mold's spark.  The following pattern demonstrates a p4 c/2 spaceship found by  Jason Summers, in which the phase is changed as it deletes a  forward glider. This phase change allows the spaceship to be used  to delete a glider wave produced by a rake whose period is 2 (mod  4).  Phase changing reactions have enabled the construction of  spaceships having periods that were otherwise unknown, and also allow  the construction of period-doubling and period-tripling convoys to  easily produce very high period rakes.

A spaceship cannot be a phoenix, and  in fact every finite phoenix eventually evolves into an oscillator.  The following 12-cell oscillator (found by the MIT group in December  1971) is the smallest known phoenix, and is sometimes called simply  \"the phoenix\".  This is extensible and is just the first of a family of phoenixes  made by joining components together to form a loop. Here is  another member of this family.  Every known phoenix oscillator has period 2. In January 2000,  Stephen Silver showed that a period 3 oscillator cannot be a phoenix.  The situation for higher periods is unknown.  An easy synthesis of the phoenix is possible using four blocks as  seeds. A puffer creating a growing row of phoenixes has the  unusual property that the percentage of live cells that stay alive  for more than one generation approaches zero. See lone dot agar  for an example of an infinite phoenix.",

Tooke produced a number of  slow-salvo-constructed patterns with superlinear growth, including  a series of breeder patterns of previously unknown types. For some  patterns, the Gemini's two construction arms were moved to a  permanent stationary platform, using fourteen glider-loop channels  instead of twelve.  Some of these breeder patterns remain difficult to classify  unambiguously. For example, one pattern was designed to be an MSS  breeder - a modified Gemini spaceship puffing slide guns which  build lines of blocks. However, the slide guns produce both moving  and stationary objects at a linear rate, because streams of gliders  are needed to reach out to the construction zone to do the push  reaction and build more blocks. The pattern could therefore be  classified as a hybrid MSM/MSS breeder. Other breeder patterns  utilizing slide guns and universal constructor technology are  likely to cause similar classification ambiguities.",

Goucher  in February 2010, which calculates the decimal digits of pi (the  transcendental number, not the Life pattern!) and displays them in  the Life universe as 8x10 dot matrix characters formed by  arrangements of blocks along a diagonal stripe at the top. A push  reaction moves a ten-block diagonal cursor to the next position as  part of the \"printing\" operation for each new digit.  The actual calculation is done in binary, using a streaming spigot  algorithm based on linear fractional transformations. The pi  calculator is made up of a 188-state computer connected to a printing  device via period-8 regulators and a binary-to-decimal conversion  mechanism. The complete pattern can be found in Golly's Very Large  Patterns online archive, along with the very similar 177-state phi  calculator which uses a simpler algorithm to calculate and print the  Golden Ratio.",

Conway's early investigations of Life and other cellular  automata involved tracking the histories of small polyominoes, this  being a reasonable way to ascertain the typical behaviour of  different cellular automata when the patterns had to be evolved by  hand rather than by computer. Polyominoes have no special  significance in Life, but their extensive study during the early  years lead to a number of important discoveries and has influenced  the terminology of Life. (Note on spelling: As with \"dominoes\" the  plural may also be spelt without an e. In this lexicon I have  followed Golomb in using the longer form.)  It is possible for a polyomino to be an oscillator. In fact  there are infinitely many examples of such polyominoes, namely the  cross and its larger analogues. The only other known examples are  the block, the blinker, the toad, the star and (in two  different phases) the pentadecathlon.  A polyomino can also be a spaceship, as the LWSS, MWSS and  HWSS show.",

See  twirling T-tetsons II for a variation on this idea. By other means  the replication of the pre-pulsar can be made to occur in just 14  generations as half of it is eaten; this allows the construction of  p28 and p29 oscillators. The pre-pulsar was also a vital component  of the first known p26 and p47 oscillators.  See also PPS.",

    "description": " Opposite of true. A gun emitting a period n stream of  spaceships (or rakes) is said to be a pseudo period n gun if its  mechanism oscillates with a period greater than n. This period will  necessarily be a multiple of n. If the base mechanism's period is  instead a fraction of n, then a period multiplier must also be  present which is considered to be part of the mechanism, and the gun  as a whole is still a true period gun. For example, a filter may  be used on a lower-period gun to produce a compound gun such as the  true p48 gun.  Pseudo period n glider guns are known to exist for all periods  greater than or equal to 14, with smaller periods being impossible.  All known p14 guns are pseudo guns requiring several signal  injections, so they are quite large. The following smaller example  is a pseudo period 123 gun, interleaving the streams from two true  period 246 guns:  The same distinction between true and pseudo also exists for  puffers.",

The definition of strict still life rules out such stable  patterns as the bi-block. In such patterns there are dead cells  which have more than 3 neighbours in total, but fewer than 3 in any  component still life. These patterns are called pseudo still lifes,  and have been enumerated up to 32 bits, as shown in the table below. -------------- Bits Number -------------- 8  1 9  1 10  7 11 16 12 55 13  110 14  279 15  620 16 1645 17 4067 18  10843 19  27250 20  70637 21 179011 22 462086 23  1184882 24  3068984 25  7906676 26 20463274 27 52816265 28  136655095 29  353198379 30  914075620 31 2364815358 32 6123084116 --------------  Attribution of these counts is given in strict still life; see  also https://oeis.org/A056613. The unique 32-bit triple pseudo  still life is included in the last count in the table. As the number  of bits increases, the pseudo still life count goes up exponentially  by approximately O(2.56^n). By comparison, the rate for  strict still lifes is about O(2.46^n) while for quasi still lifes  it's around O(3.04^n).  If a stable pattern's live cells plus its overpopulated dead cells  do not form a single mutually adjacent group, the pattern is usually  referred to as a constellation. It is also a still life in the  general sense, but is neither \"pseudo\" nor \"strict\".",

    "name": "puffer",
    "description": " An object that moves like a spaceship, except that it leaves  debris behind. The first known puffers were found by Bill Gosper and  travelled at c/2 orthogonally (see diagram below for the very first  one, found in 1971).  Not long afterwards c/12 diagonal puffers were found (see  switch engine). Discounting wickstretchers, which are not  puffers in the conventional sense, no new velocity was obtained after  this until David Bell found the first c/3 orthogonal puffer in April  1996. Other new puffer speeds followed over the next several years.  Many spaceships that travel orthogonally at a speed less than c/2  have useful side or back sparks. These can be used to perturb  standard spaceships that approach from behind. A common technique  for creating puffers for a new speed uses a convoy of the new  spaceships to create debris from an approaching standard spaceship  such that a new standard spaceship is recreated on the same path as  the original one. This forms a closed loop, resulting in a  high-period puffer for the new speed.  As of June 2018, puffers have been found matching every known  velocity of elementary spaceship, except for c/6 and c/7 diagonal  and (2,1)c/6. It is also generally easy to create puffers based on  macro-spaceships, simply by removing some part of the trailing  cleanup mechanism.",

May refer specifically to the  extensible c/2 spaceship constructed by Ivan Fomichev in December  2014, the first such spaceship to contain no period-2 or period-4  parts. (The first two or three rows might be considered to be period  2 or 4, but they are directly dependent on following rows for  support.).  The pattern consists of two adjacent pufferfish puffers, plus  four copies of a nontrivial period 36 c/2 fuse for pufferfish  exhaust, discovered using a randomized soup search.",

It consists of a B-heptomino (shown here one generation  before the standard form) escorted by two LWSS. (This was the  second known puffer. The first is shown under puffer.)  In April 2006, Jason Summers found a way to make the classic puffer  train into a p20 spaceship by adding a glider at the back:",

A common  synonym is period multiplier. For n=2, the simplest known stable  pulse dividers are the semi-Snarks.  The following diagram shows a p5 glider pulse divider by Dieter  Leithner (February 1998). The first glider moves the centre block  and is reflected at 90 degrees. The next glider to come along will  not be reflected, but will move the block back to its original  position. The relatively small size and low period of this example  made it useful for constructing compact glider guns of certain  periods, but it became largely obsolete with the discovery of the  stable CC semi-Snark, which uses the same basic mechanism.  Period 7, 22, 36 and 46 versions of this pulse divider are also  known.",

In April 2011, Stephen Silver gave an example of a one-cell-thick  pattern over a million cells long that exhibited quadratic growth.  In October 2015, Chris Cain constructed a one-cell-thick pattern with  a reduced bounding box of 2596x1, improving on a series of previous  longer results. The smallest known quadratic growth pattern by  initial population is the 23-cell switch-engine ping-pong by  Michael Simkin.

However, this  adds 5 ticks to the repeat time, so that it becomes 48. If period  quadrupling is needed with a colour-changing reaction, a  CP semi-Snark and a CC semi-Snark can be used in series, or a  period-multiplying Herschel conduit can be connected to a syringe  and an appropriately chosen Herschel-to-glider converter.",

There are many ways that the two shuttles can be placed,  either head-to-head, or else at right angles. The most well-known  and useful arrangement results in the Gosper glider gun.  Other arrangements don't create any lasting output, but create  large sparks which can perturb objects (especially gliders) in  various ways. For example, one arrangement of a queen bee shuttle  pair was used in the original unit Life cell as a memory cell.  Here an input glider is converted into a block, which remains until  it is deleted by a glider on a right-angled path.  See p690 gun and metamorphosis II for two more examples.",

This was  Dieter Leithner's name for the true p54 glider gun he built in  January 1998 - a short form of Quetzalcoatlus, which expresses the  fact that the gun was a very large Herschel loop that was not an  emu. Shortly afterwards Leithner also built a p56 Quetzal using a  mechanism found by Noam Elkies for this purpose. In October 1998  Stephen Silver constructed a p55 Quetzal using Elkies' p5 reflector  of the previous month. Quetzals of periods 57-61 have since been  constructed.  Some of the more recent Quetzals are not Herschel loops, but are  instead short Herschel tracks firing several glider streams all but  one of which is reflected back to the beginning of the track to  create a new Herschel. Noam Elkies first had the idea of doing this  for the p55 case, and Stephen Silver constructed the resulting gun  shortly after building the original (much larger) p55 Quetzal. Jason  Summers later built a p54 version, which is more complicated because  the evenness of the period makes the timing problems considerably  more difficult.",

    "description": " Any puffer whose debris consists of spaceships. A rake is  said to be forwards, backwards or sideways according to the direction  of the spaceships relative to the direction of the rake. Originally  the term \"rake\" was applied only to forwards c/2 glider puffers (see  space rake). Many people prefer not to use the term in the case  where the puffed spaceships travel parallel or anti-parallel to the  puffer, as in this case they do not rake out any significant region  of the Life plane (and, in contrast to true rakes, these puffers  cannot travel in a stream, and so could never be produced by a  gun).  Although the first rakes (circa 1971) were c/2, rakes of other  velocities have since been built. Dean Hickerson's construction of  Corderships in 1991 made it easy for c/12 diagonal rakes to be  built, although no one actually did this until 1998, by which time  David Bell had constructed c/3 and c/5 rakes (May 1996 and September  1997, respectively). Jason Summers constructed a 2c/5 rake in June  2000 (building on work by Paul Tooke and David Bell) and a c/4  orthogonal rake in October 2000 (based largely on reactions found by  David Bell).  The smallest possible period for a rake is probably 7, as this  could be achieved by a 3c/7 orthogonal backwards glider puffer. The  smallest period attained to date is 8 (Jason Summers' backrake,  March 2001).",

This term is used for  Herschel circuits and other stable circuitry, whereas  construction envelope is specific to recipes in self-constructing  circuitry.  There are some subtleties at the edges of the envelope.  Specifically, two reactions that have the exact same set of cells  defining their envelopes may have different behavior when placed next  to a single-cell protrusion like the tail of an eater1, or one side  of a tub. The difference depends on whether two orthogonally  adjacent cells at the edge of the envelope are ever simultaneously  alive, within the protruding cell's zone of influence.",

This provides one way for  signals that have been frozen in place by some previous reaction to  be released for use.  Simple reactions using period 4 c/2 spaceships have been found for  reanimating a block, boat, beehive, ship, loaf, bi-block,  or toad. The most interesting of these is for a beehive since it  seems to require an unusual p4 spaceship:  Reanimation of a loaf is used many times in the Caterloopillar.  It is also used in the Caterpillar as part of its catch and throw  mechanism. Finally, reanimation can produce rakes from some  puffers. See stop and restart for a similar idea that applies to  Herschel conduits and other signal circuitry.  There are small objects which have no known reanimation reactions  using c/2 ships other than the brute force method of hitting them  with the output of rakes.",

The  rectifier has the same output glider as the boojum reflector but a  much shorter repeat time of only 106 ticks.  Another advantage of the rectifier is that the output glider is on  a transparent lane, so it can be used in logic circuitry to merge  two signal paths.",

    "name": "recursive filter",
    "description": " A toolkit developed by Alexey Nigin in July 2015,  which enables the construction of patterns with population growth  that asymptotically matches an infinite number of different  superlinear functions. Toolkits enabling other, sublinear infinite  series had been completed by Dean Hickerson and Gabriel Nivasch in  2006. See quadratic filter and exponential filter.  Sublinear functions are possible using the recursive-filter toolkit  as well. It can be used to construct a glider-emitting pattern with  a slowness rate S(t) = O(log***...*(t)), the nth-level iterated  logarithm of t, which asymptotically dominates any  primitive-recursive function f(t).",

  {
    "name": "reflector",
    "description": " Any stable or oscillating pattern that can reflect some  type of spaceship (usually a glider) without suffering permanent  damage. A pattern that is damaged or destroyed during the reflection  process is generally called a one-time turner instead.  The first known reflector was the pentadecathlon, which functions  as a 180-degree glider reflector (see relay). Other examples  include the buckaroo, the twin bees shuttle and some oscillators  based on the traffic jam reaction. Glider guns can also be made  into reflectors, although these are mostly rather large.  In September 1998 Noam Elkies found some fast small-period glider  reflectors, with oscillators supplying the required domino  sparks at different periods. A figure-8 produced a p8 bouncer,  and a p6 pipsquirter produced an equivalent p6 bouncer. A more  complicated construction allows a p5 bouncer (which, as had been  anticipated, soon led to a true p55 Quetzal gun). And in August  1999 Elkies found a suitable sparker to produce a p7 bouncer,  allowing the first p49 oscillator to be constructed.  These were all called simply \"p5 reflector\", \"p6 reflector\", etc.,  until 6 April 2016 when Tanner Jacobi discovered an equally small and  simple reaction, the bumper, starting with a loaf as bait  instead of a boat. This resulted in a series of periodic  colour-preserving reflectors, whereas Elkies' bouncer reflectors  are all colour-changing. A useful mnemonic is that \"bouncer\"  contains a C and is colour-changing, whereas \"bumper\" contains a P  and is colour-preserving.  Stable reflectors are special in that if they satisfy certain  conditions they can be used to construct oscillators of all  sufficiently large periods. It was known for some time that stable  reflectors were possible (see universal constructor), but no one  was able to construct an explicit example until Paul Callahan did so  in October 1996.  Callahan's original reflector has a repeat time of 4840, soon  improved to 1686, then 894, and then 850. In November 1996 Dean  Hickerson found a variant in which this is reduced to 747. Dave  Buckingham reduced it to 672 in May 1997 using a somewhat different  method, and in October 1997 Stephen Silver reduced it to 623 by a  method closer to the original. In November 1998 Callahan reduced  this to 575 with a new initial reaction. A small modification by  Silver a few days later brought this down to 497.  In April 2001 Dave Greene found a 180-degree stable reflector with  a repeat time of only 202 (see boojum reflector). This reflector  won bounties offered by Dieter Leithner and Alan Hensel. Half of the  prize money was recycled into a new prize for a small 90-degree  reflector, which in turn was won by Mike Playle's colour-preserving  Snark reflector. The Snark is currently the smallest known stable  reflector, with a recovery time of 43. Playle has offered a $100  prize for a colour-changing stable reflector contained within a 25  by 25 bounding box, with a recovery time of 50 generations or less.  As of June 2018, the following splitter is among the smallest  known 90-degree colour-changing reflectors. The top output can  be blocked off by an eater if needed. For small 180-degree  colour-changing reflectors see rectifier, and also the sample  pattern in splitter.",

If the distance to that object is measured using circuitry  designed to be as simple as possible, a complete decoder and  universal constructor can be created by colliding a small number of  gliders - no more than 329 according to a June 2018  glider synthesis, and exactly 43 according to a July 1 redesign by  Chris Cain using eight far-distant GPSEs and, amazingly, no  stationary circuitry except for a single catalyst block. Some  intermediate designs with 50+ gliders need no stationary circuitry at  all.  With the correct placement of the faraway object, the complete  pattern is theoretically capable of building any glider-constructible  object. This means that 43 is the maximum number of gliders required  to build any constructible object, no matter what size. However, it  is not possible to determine in practice what the locations of these  43 gliders should be, even for a relatively simple construction.",

In Life the term refers  to a specific ASCII encoding used for patterns in Conway's Life and  other similar cellular automata. This encoding was introduced by  Dave Buckingham and is now the usual means of exchanging relatively  small patterns by email or in online forum discussions.  As an example of the rle format, here is a representation of the  Gosper glider gun. The \"run lengths\" are the numbers, b's are dead  cells, o's are live cells, and dollar signs signal new lines: x = 36, y = 9, rule = B3/S23 24bo$22bobo$12boo6boo12boo$11bo3bo4boo12boo$oo8bo 5bo3boo$oo8bo3boboo4bobo$10bo5bo7bo$11bo3bo$12boo!  Over the years RLE format has been extended to handle patterns with  multiple states, neighborhoods, rules, and universe sizes. A  completely different encoding, macrocell format, is used for  repetitive patterns that may have very large populations.",

This converter has several common uses. It can be attached to the  L156 Herschel conduit to change it into a useful  period doubler. Connecting it to the initial stage of the L156  produces a composite Herschel-to-glider converter often used as a  splitter, or as a quasi-edge shooter after suppressing the  additional glider output:  The above H-to-2G mechanism appears in many places in the glider gun  collection, for example, mainly for periods below 78 where syringes  can't be used to build small true-period guns. The insertion  reaction allows a glider to be placed 19 ticks in front of another  glider on the same lane, or 30 ticks behind it (28 if the  perpendicular glider output is suppressed.)",

Compare flotilla. In  contrast with a convoy, the spaceships in a salvo are usually  consumed by the reactions that they cause. Simple examples include  block pusher and block pull.  Salvos may be slow or synchronized. The following partially  synchronized three-glider salvo produces an LWSS from a block.  The above is a synchronized salvo and not a slow salvo, because the  second glider must follow the first with the exact separation shown.  The third glider can be considered to be a slow glider, because it  will still delete the temporary loaf no matter how many ticks it is  delayed. The slow glider construction entry includes an example of  a true slow salvo.",

(In other words, the population  reaches new heights infinitely often, but also infinitely often  returns to some fixed value.) Conway's preferred plural is  \"sawteeth\".  The first sawtooth was constructed by Dean Hickerson in April 1991.  The current smallest known sawtooth was found by a conwaylife.com  forum user with the online handle 'thunk'. It has a bounding box of  74x60, and is the smallest known sawtooth in terms of its minimum  repeating population of 177 cells. The following variant has a higher  repeating population of 194 and an optimized bounding box of 62x56:  Patterns combining a fast puffer with a slower spaceship have  also been constructed (see moving sawtooth).

See blinker ship  for an example perturbation of the spark. The diagram below shows  the smallest form of the Schick engine, using two LWSS.

    "description": " A computer program or script that automates the search  for Life objects having certain desired properties. These are used  because the difficulty of finding previously unknown Life objects now  commonly exceeds the patience, speed, and accuracy of humans.  Various types of search programs are used for finding objects such as  spaceships, oscillators, drifters, catalysts, soups,  Garden of Edens, and slow salvos.  Some search programs generate partial results as they are  running, so even if they don't complete successfully, something of  use might still be salvaged from the run.  Example search programs are dr, lifesrc, gfind, and  Bellman.  There are other types of programs which don't perform searches as  such, but instead perform large constructions.

Caterpillar has been used as a general term for self-supporting  spaceships, but it is not very appropriate for the HBKs.  In general a self-supporting pattern cannot be trivially adjusted  to alter its speed or direction. The variable speeds of the HBKs and  the Caterloopillars are exceptions, but their direction of travel is  fixed, and a specific Caterloopillar can't be made to change its  speed without completely rebuilding it.

    "description": " Any small stable signal conduit that produces one  output glider for every two input gliders, with a 90 degree  reflection. These can act as period-doublers for any glider stream  whose period is at least equal to their repeat time, and so adding  one of these to a single glider gun often results in a pattern much  smaller than the older technology of crossing the output of two  guns.  The available semi-Snarks differ in their complexity, size, repeat  time, and the colour of their output gliders. The CC semi-Snark  was the first one found, and the term \"semi-Snark\" is often used  specifically for this object. The \"CC\" prefix stands for  colour-changing, by contrast with the more recently discovered  colour-preserving CP semi-Snark.  There are also CC and CP variants of a semi-Snark based on a  two-glider to century converter discovered by Tanner Jacobi in  November 2017. These semi-cenarks are the fastest semi-Snarks  known as of July 2018, with a repeat time as low as 50 ticks, or a  periodic input rate as low as 36 ticks.",

Spaceships can only transfer a signal at the speed of the spaceship,  while fuses can transfer a signal at speeds up to the  speed of light.  In practice, many signals are encoded as the presence or absence of  a glider or other spaceship at a particular point at a particular  time. Such signals can be combined by the collision of gliders to  form logic operations such as AND, OR, and NOT gates. Signals can be  duplicated using glider duplicators or other fanout devices, and  can be used up by causing perturbations on other parts of the Life  object.  Signals are used in Herschel conduit circuitry,  universal constructors, macro-spaceships, and other computational  patterns such as the pi calculator and Osqrtlogt patterns.",

A Snark could reasonably be called a  \"glider elbow\", but glider reflector is the standard term. A  signal elbow with a recovery time less than 20 ticks would enable a  trivial proof that Conway's Life is omniperiodic.  A near miss is the following elbow-like converter found by Dean  Hickerson. It successfully turns a 2c/3 signal by 90 degrees, but  unfortunately changes it to a double-length signal in the process.  This means that further copies of the converter can not be appended  (e.g., to make a closed loop).  Relatively small composite MWSS elbows can now be constructed,  using Tanner Jacobi's 2015 discovery of a small H-to-MWSS  component. For example, the Orthogonoid includes a  constructor/reflector that reflects an MWSS stream by 180 degrees,  but it can be trivially reconfigured to make a 90-degree MWSS elbow.",

    "description": " A type of universal constructor discovered and  developed by Simon Ekstrom and others starting in December 2015. The  initial elbow operation toolkit was near-minimal, with just one  push, one pull, and one output glider of each colour (see  colour of a glider). Later searches produced a much larger and  more efficient library.  Single-channel recipes consist of a stream of gliders on a  single lane and aimed at a construction elbow, usually separated  from each other by at least 90 ticks. In spite of these strict  limitations, single-channel recipes can be made to do surprising  things. For example, it is possible to build a Snark directly on  the construction lane of an active construction arm, starting from  a single elbow block. This can allow the arm to reach  efficiently around complex obstructions by bending itself through  multiple lossless elbows. Known recipes can also remove an elbow  when it is no longer needed, by controlled demolition of the Snark.  As of June 2018, almost all single-channel recipes are made up of  singletons and synchronized pairs of gliders, but no synchronized  triplets or larger groups. This is not an inherent limitation of  single-channel construction, but rather a limitation in the  search program used to find currently known single-channel  toolkits.  A useful byproduct of this limitation is that single-channel  recipes can be trivially adjusted to allow them to safely cross  perpendicular data streams, including other single-channel recipes  (or earlier parts of the same recipe). To avoid collisions with a  crossing stream, each singleton glider or glider pair can safely be  delayed by any even number of ticks, or technically by any multiple  of the period of the current intermediate target. The final result  of the construction will not be affected.",

The  arm consists of streams of spaceships which are pushing a pattern  away from the body of the gun and releasing an output spaceship every  time they do so. Each output spaceship therefore travels along a  different path.  Dieter Leithner constructed the first slide gun in July 1994  (although he used the term \"side shooting gun\"). The following  pattern shows the key reaction of this slide gun. The three gliders  shown will push the block one cell diagonally, thereby extending the  length of the arm by one cell, and at the same time they release an  output glider sideways. (In 1999, Jason Summers constructed slide  guns using other reactions.)",

In Conway's original formulation (as part of his proof of the  existence of a universal computer in Life) two gliders were used to  pull the block inwards by three diagonal spaces, as shown below, and  thirty gliders were used to push it out by the same amount.  Dean Hickerson later greatly improved on this, finding a way to  pull a block inwards by one diagonal space using 2 gliders, and push  it out the same distance using 3 gliders. In order for the memory to  be of any use there also has to be a way to read the value held. It  suffices to be able to check whether the value is zero (as Conway  did), or to be able to detect the transition from one to zero (as  Hickerson did).  Dean Hickerson's sliding block memory is used in Paul Chapman's  URM, and the key salvos from it are used in several other complex  constructions, such as David Bell's Collatz 5N+1 simulator and Adam  P. Goucher's pi calculator and Spartan  universal computer-constructor.",

It accepts as input a constellation of sufficiently widely  separated still lifes, and produces a glider stream that will  perform a complete slow glider construction of that constellation,  starting from a single block.  One of slmake's primary uses is to make self-constructing  patterns much easier to design and build. It is capable of finding  recipes not only for Spartan stable circuitry, but also for  other useful non-Spartan circuits such as Snarks, syringes, and  H-to-MWSS converters, provided that they are separated from other  nearby objects by a sufficient amount of empty space.",

Unlike a standard elbow which is  generally fixed on a single construction lane or at least within a  narrow range, a slow elbow can move freely in two dimensions as long  as there is room for it. Each slow elbow added to a construction arm  results in an exponential increase in the cost (in gliders) of the  final construction. Compare lossless elbow.",

    "name": "slow glider construction",
    "description": " Construction an object by a \"slow salvo\" of  gliders all coming from the same direction, in such a way that  timing of the gliders does not matter as long as they are not too  close behind one another. This type of construction requires an  initial seed object, such as a block, which is modified by each  glider in turn until the desired object is produced.  In May 1997, Nick Gotts produced a slow glider construction of a  block-laying switch engine from a block, using a slow salvo of 53  gliders. Constructions like this are important in the study of  sparse Life, as they will occur naturally as gliders created in the  first few generations collide with blonks and other debris.  Slow glider constructions are also useful in some designs for  universal constructors. However, in this case the above definition  is usually too restrictive, and it is desirable to allow  constructions in which some gliders in the salvo are required to have  a particular timing modulo 2 (a \"p2 slow salvo\"). This gives much  greater flexibility, as blinkers can now be freely used in the  intermediate construction steps. The Snarkmaker is a very large p2  slow salvo. A much smaller example is the following edgy  construction of an eater1 starting from a block.  Adam P. Goucher's slmake search program, made available in May  2017, makes it much easier to find a slow glider construction for a  wide variety of stable circuitry.",

    "name": "soup",
    "description": " A random initial pattern, either contained within a small area,  or alternatively filling the whole Life universe.  Finite soups probably have behaviors very different than infinite  soups, but this is obviously unknown. Infinite soups may remain  chaotic indefinitely since any reaction, no matter how rare, is bound  to happen somewhere.  Soups can have an average density, with results varying based on  that. See sparse Life for a discussion of what can happen at a low  density.  Finite soups for sizes such as 16x16 (asymmetric) have been  examined by the billions by scripts such as apgsearch to find  interesting results. Many new oscillators and synthesis  recipes have been discovered, as well as previously known rare  patterns such as stabilized switch engines. In addition, soups are  used to generate statistical census data, and to decide whether  specific objects can be considered natural.  Soups can be fully random, or they can be forced to be symmetric.  The results for these two types of soups can differ since symmetric  soups tend to create large symmetrical objects at a much higher rate.  Shown below is an unusual mirror-symmetric soup that produces a  pufferfish and nothing else.",

Spacefillers can be considered as breeders (more precisely,  MMS breeders), but they are very different from ordinary breeders.  The word \"spacefiller\" was suggested by Harold McIntosh and soon  became the accepted term.",

    "name": "spaceship",
    "description": " Any finite pattern that reappears (without additions or  losses) after a number of generations and displaced by a non-zero  amount. By far the most natural spaceships are the glider,  LWSS, MWSS and HWSS, followed by the Coe ship which has also  evolved multiple times from random asymmetric soup starting  conditions. See also the entries on individual spaceship speeds:  c/2 spaceship, c/3 spaceship, c/4 spaceship, c/5 spaceship,  c/6 spaceship, c/7 spaceship, c/10 spaceship, c/12 spaceship,  2c/5 spaceship, 2c/7 spaceship, 3c/7 spaceship,  (2,1)c/6 spaceship, and 17c/45 spaceship.  It is known that there exist spaceships travelling in all rational  directions and at arbitrarily slow speeds (see  universal constructor). Before 1989, however, the only known  examples travelled at c/4 diagonally (gliders) or c/2 orthogonally  (everything else).  In 1989 Dean Hickerson started to use automated searches to look  for new elementary spaceships, and had considerable success. Other  people have continued these searches using tools such as lifesrc  and gfind, and as a result we now have a great variety of  elementary spaceships travelling at sixteen different velocities.  The following table details the discovery of elementary spaceships  with new velocities as of July 2018.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Speed Direction First Discovery  Discoverer  Date  ------------------------------------------------------------------- c/4 diagonal  glider Richard Guy  1970 c/2 orthogonal LWSS John Conway  1970 c/3 orthogonal 25P3H1V0.1 Dean Hickerson  Aug  1989 c/4 orthogonal 119P4H1V0  Dean Hickerson  Dec  1989 c/12  diagonal  Cordership Dean Hickerson  Apr  1991 2c/5  orthogonal 44P5H2V0 Dean Hickerson  Jul  1991 c/5 orthogonal snail  Tim Coe Jan  1996 2c/7  orthogonal weekender  David Eppstein  Jan  2000 c/6 orthogonal dragon Paul Tooke  Apr  2000 c/5 diagonal  295P5H1V1  Jason Summers Nov  2000 c/6 diagonal  seal Nicolay Beluchenko Sep  2005 c/7 diagonal  lobster  Matthias Merzenich Aug  2011 c/7 orthogonal loafer Josh Ball Feb  2013 c/10  orthogonal copperhead zdr Mar  2016 3c/7  orthogonal spaghetti monster Tim Coe Jun  2016 (2,1)c/7 oblique Sir Robin  Adam P. Goucher Mar  2018  -------------------------------------------------------------------  Several infinite families of adjustable-velocity macro-spaceships  have also been constructed, of which the first was Gabriel Nivasch's  Caterpillar from December 2004. The macro-spaceship with the  widest range of possible speeds is Michael Simkin's Caterloopillar  from April 2016; in theory it supports any rational orthogonal speed  strictly less than c<4. A somewhat similar design supporting any  rational speed strictly less than c/2 has been shown to be feasible,  but as of July 2018 no explicit examples have been constructed.  A period p spaceship that displaces itself (m,n) during its period,  where m>=n, is said to be of type (m,n)/p. It was proved by Conway  in 1970 that p>=2m+2n. (This follows immediately from the  easily-proved fact that a pattern cannot advance diagonally at a rate  greater than one half diagonal step every other generation.)",

These both absorb gliders as a  standard eater does, but also produce separated single-bit sparks  at the upper right, which can be used to delete antiparallel gliders  with different phases as shown.  The above mechanisms can be used to build intermitting glider guns.  The left-hand eater produces a spark nine ticks after a glider  impact, with the result that the period of the constituent guns can't  be a multiple of 4. The right-hand eater produces the same spark ten  ticks after impact, which allows p4N guns to be used.  The separation of the spark also allows this reaction to perform  other perturbations \"around the corner\" of some objects. For  example, it was used by Jason Summers in 2004 to cap the ends of a  row of ten AK47 reactions to form a much smaller period 94 glider  gun than the original one. (This is now made obsolete by the  AK94 gun.)",

Much later it will be dominated by simple  infinite growth patterns (presumably mostly switch engines). The  long-term fate of a sparse Life universe is less certain. It may  possibly become dominated by self-reproducing patterns (see  universal constructor), but it is not at all clear that there is  any mechanism for these to deal with all the junk produced by switch  engines.",

Other small objects may sometimes be counted as Spartan, including  period-2 oscillators - mainly blinkers, but also beacons or  toads, which may occur as intermediate targets in slow salvo  recipes. Most self-constructing patterns are Spartan or mostly  Spartan, to simplify the process of self-construction.",

The original speed booster is  based on p30 technology, and is shown below:  Here the top glider is boosted by passing through two  inline inverters, emerging 5 cells further along than the unboosted  glider at the left.  The fastest speed boosters are the telegraph and p1 telegraph,  which can transfer a orthogonal signal at the speed of light,  although their bit rate is rather slow.  Diagonal speed boosters have also been built using 2c/3 wires or  other stable components. See stable pseudo-Heisenburp.  The star gate seems like it can transfer a signal faster than the  speed of light. The illusion is explained in  Fast Forward Force Field.",

An older term for this is fanout, or \"fanout device\".  A sub-category is the one-time splitter, which is not technically  a converter because it can only be used once. One-time splitters are  usually small constellations that produce two or more clean  gliders when struck by a single glider. In other words, they are  multi-glider seeds. These are important for constructing  self-destruct circuitry in self-constructing spaceships.  The following combination, a syringe attached to an SE7T14  converter combined with an NW31 converter, is one of the smallest  known glider splitters as of July 2018. Another small splitter with  a 90-degree colour-changing output is shown under reflector.",

The only known types of stabilized switch engines were found by  Charles Corderman soon after he discovered the switch engine itself.  There is a p288 block-laying type (the more common of the two) and  the p384 glider-producing type. These two puffers are the most  natural infinite growth patterns in Life. As of June 2018 they are  the basis for every infinite growth pattern ever seen to occur from a  random asymmetric soup, even after trillions of census results by  apgsearch and similar projects.  Patterns giving rise to block-laying switch engines can be seen  under infinite growth, and one giving rise to a glider-producing  switch engine is shown under time bomb.  Here is the block-laying type showing its distinctive zig-zag trail  of blocks.",

    "description": " A multi-stage converter constructed by  Dave Greene in January 2007, using a complex recipe found by Noam  Elkies to insert a signal into a 2c/3 wire. The wire's high  transmission speed allows a signal from a highway robber to catch  up to a salvo of gliders. Ultimately the mechanism restores the  key glider, which was destroyed by the highway robber in the first  stage of the converter, to its exact original position in the salvo.  Much smaller stable pseudo-Heisenburp devices have since been  designed that use simple 0-degree glider seed constellations  instead of a 2c/3 wire.  These patterns are labeled \"pseudo-Heisenburp\", because a true  Heisenburp device does not even temporarily damage or affect a  passing glider, yet can still produce an output signal in response.  However, it is impossible to construct a stable device that can  accomplish this for gliders. True stable Heisenburp devices are  possible with many other types of spaceships, but not with gliders  which have no usable side sparks to initiate an output signal.",

    "name": "staged recovery",
    "description": " A type of signal-processing circuit where the  initial reaction between catalysts an incoming signal results in an  imperfect recovery. A catalyst is damaged, destroyed completely as  in a bait reaction, or one or more objects are left behind that  must be cleaned up before the circuit can be reused. In any of these  three cases, output signals from the circuit must be used to complete  the cleanup. In theory the cleanup process might itself be dirty,  requiring additional cleanup stages. In rare cases this might  theoretically allow the construction of special-purpose circuits with  a lower recovery time than would otherwise be possible, but in  practice this kind of situation does not commonly arise.  An example is the record-breaking (at the time) 487-tick reflector  constructed by Adam P. Goucher on 12 April 2009. 487 ticks was a  slight improvement over the repeat time of the Silver reflector.  The reflector featured a standard Callahan G-to-H, with cleanup by  an internal dirty glider reflector found by Dieter Leithner many  years before. This in turn was cleaned up by the usual ungainly  Herschel plumbing attached to the G-to-H's output. The dirty glider  reflector is not actually fully recovered before a second p487 signal  enters the full reflector. However, it has been repaired by the time  the internal reflector is actually needed again, so the cycle can be  successfully repeated at p487 instead of p497.",

Many stamp collections contain \"fonts\" made of single cells (which  cleanly die) to annotate the objects or to draw boxes around them.  For example, here is a stamp collection which shows all the ways that  two gliders can create a loaf or an eater:  Alternatively, stamp collections can use LifeHistory for their  annotations, but this requires a more sophisticated Life program to  handle. Numbers, or more rarely letters, are sometimes constructed  from stable components such as blocks or snakes, but their  readability is somewhat limited by placement constraints.",

For the purposes of enumerating still lifes this  definition is, however, unsatisfactory because, for example, any pair  of blocks would count as a still life, and there would therefore be  an infinite number of 8-bit still lifes.  For this reason a stricter definition is often used, counting a  stable pattern as a strict still life only if its islands cannot  be divided into two or more nonempty sets both of which are stable in  their own right. If such a subdivision can be made, the pattern can  be referred to as a constellation. If its cells form a single  cluster it is also, more specifically, either a pseudo still life  or a quasi still life.  In rare cases above a certain size threshold, a pattern may be  divisible into three or four stable nonempty subsets but not into  two. See the 32-bit triple pseudo (32 bits) and the 34-bit  quad pseudo for examples.  All still lifes up to 18 bits have been shown to be  glider constructible. It is an open question whether all still  lifes can be incrementally constructed using glider collisions. For  a subset of small still lifes that have been found to be especially  useful in self-constructing circuitry, see also Spartan.  The smallest still life is the block. Arbitrarily large still  lifes are easy to construct, for example by extending a canoe or  barge. The maximum density of a large still life is 1/2, which can  be achieved by an arbitrarily large patch of zebra stripes or  chicken wire, among many other options. See density for more  precise limits.",

This can be used either as a memory device  storing one bit of information, or as a simple delay mechanism. In  the following January 2016 example by Martin Grant, a  ghost Herschel marks the output signal location, and a \"ghost  beehive\" marks the location of the intermediate still life.  The eater1 in the lower left corner catches the restart glider if  no input signal has come in to create the beehive. This eater could  be removed if it is useful to have both a \"0\" and a \"1\" output for a  memory cell mechanism.  The catch and throw technology in a Caterpillar is a somewhat  similar idea.

For  example, beehive with tail is a strict still life because it is  connected, and table on table is a strict still life because  neither of the tables are stable by themselves. See also  triple pseudo, quad pseudo.  Still lifes have been enumerated by Conway (4-7 bits), Robert  Wainwright (8-10 bits), Dave Buckingham (11-13 bits), Peter Raynham  (14 bits), Mark Niemiec (15-24 bits), and Simon Ekstrom and Nathaniel  Johnston (25-32 bits). The resulting figures are shown below; see  also https://oeis.org/A019473. The most recent search by Nathaniel  Johnston has also confirmed that the triple pseudo pattern found by  Gabriel Nivasch is the only such still life with 32 bits or less. It  is therefore included in the pseudo still life count and not in the  table below. -------------- Bits Number -------------- 4  2 5  1 6  5 7  4 8  9 9 10 10 25 11 46 12  121 13  240 14  619 15 1353 16 3286 17 7773 18  19044 19  45759 20 112243 21 273188 22 672172 23  1646147 24  4051711 25  9971377 26 24619307 27 60823008 28  150613157 29  373188952 30  926068847 31 2299616637 32 5716948683 --------------  As the number of bits increases, the strict still life count goes  up exponentially by approximately O(2.46^n).

    "name": "superlinear growth",
    "description": " Growth faster than any rate proportional to T,  where T is the number of ticks that a pattern has been run. This  term usually applies to a pattern's population growth, rather than  diametric growth or bounding-box growth. For example, breeders'  and spacefillers' population asymptotically grows faster than any  linear-growth pattern. It may also be used to describe the rate of  increase in the number of subpatterns present in a pattern, such as  when describing a replicator's rate of reproduction. Due to limits  enforced by the speed of light, no pattern's population can grow at  an asymptotic rate faster than quadratic growth. See  switch-engine ping-pong for the lowest-population superlinear  growth pattern as of July 2018, along with a list of the  record-holders.",

    "name": "superstring",
    "description": " An infinite orthogonal row of cells stabilized on one  side so that it moves at the speed of light, often leaving debris  behind. The first examples were found in 1971 by Edward Fitzgerald  and Robert Wainwright. Superstrings were studied extensively by  Peter Rott during 1992-1994, and he found examples with many  different periods. (But no odd periods. In August 1998 Stephen  Silver proved that odd-period superstrings are impossible.)  Sometimes a finite section of a superstring can be made to run  between two tracks (\"waveguides\"). This gives a fuse which can be  made as wide as desired. The first example was found by Tony  Smithurst and uses tubs. (This is shown below. The superstring  itself is p4 with a repeating section of width 9 producing one  blinker per period and was one of those discovered in 1971. With the  track in place, however, the period is 8. This track can also be  used with a number of other superstrings.) Shortly after seeing this  example, in March 1997 Peter Rott found another superstring track  consisting of boats. At present these are the only two waveguides  known. Both are destroyed by the superstring as it moves along. It  would be interesting to find one that remains intact.  See titanic toroidal traveler for another example of a  superstring.",

    "description": " A signal-carrying circuit that can send output signals to  two or more different locations, depending on the state of the  mechanism. These may be toggle circuits, where the state of the  switch changes after each use, or permanent switches that retain  the same state through many uses until a change is made with a  separate signal.  More generally, any circuit may be referred to as a switch, if it  can alter its output based on stored information. For example, the  following simple mechanism based on an eater2 was discovered by  Emerson J. Perkins in 2007. It either reflects or absorbs an  incoming signal, depending on the presence or absence of a nearby  block. The block is removed if a reflection occurs.  The switching signal here is a glider produced by a high-clearance  syringe variant found by Matthias Merzenich. The syringe is not  technically part of the switch mechanism; any standard Herschel  source can deliver the signal to the block factory (the two  eater1s on the right side of the pattern). Alternate converter  mechanisms could also be used to place the block.  An earlier example of the same type of one-time switch mechanism,  also mediated by a block, can be found in the NW34T204 H-to-G. See  also bistable switch for a very robust and versatile toggle switch  with two input lanes and four possible outputs.",

    "description": " The following pattern discovered by Charles Corderman  in 1971, which is a glide symmetric unstable puffer which moves  diagonally at a speed of c/12 (8 cells every 96 generations).  The exhaust is dirty and unfortunately catches up and destroys  the switch engine before it runs 13 full periods. Corderman found  several ways to stabilize the switch engine to produce puffers,  using either one or two switch engines in tandem. See  stabilized switch engine and ark.  No spaceships were able to be made from switch engines until Dean  Hickerson found the first one in April 1991 (see Cordership).  Switch engine technology is now well-advanced, producing many c/12  diagonal spaceships, puffers, and rakes of many periods.  Small polyominoes exist whose evolution results in a switch  engine. See nonomino switch engine predecessor.  Several three-glider collisions produce dirty reactions that  produce a stabilized switch engine along with other ash, making  infinite growth. Until recently the only known syntheses for  clean unstabilized switch engines used four or more gliders. There  are several such recipes. In the reaction shown below no glider  arrives from the direction that the switch engine will travel to,  making it easier to repeat the reaction:  Running the above for 20 ticks completes a kickback reaction with  the top two gliders, resulting in the three-glider switch engine  recipe discovered by Luka Okanishi on 12 March 2017.",

    "name": "symmetric",
    "description": " Any object which can be rotated and/or flipped over an axis  and still maintain the same shape. Many common small objects such as  the block, beehive, pond, loaf, clock, and blinker are  symmetric. Some larger symmetric objects are Kok's galaxy,  Achim's p16, cross, Eureka, and the pulsar.  Large symmetric objects can easily be created by placing multiple  copies of any finite object together in a symmetrical way. Unless  the individual objects interact significantly, this is considered  trivial and is not considered further here (e.g., two LWSSs  travelling together a hundred cells apart).  There are two kinds of symmetry. Odd symmetry occurs when an  object's line of reflection passes through the center of a line of  cells. Objects with odd symmetry have an odd number of columns or  rows, and can have a gutter. Even symmetry occurs when the line of  reflection follows the boundary between two lines of cells. Objects  with even symmetry have an even number of columns or rows.  Because the Life universe and its rules are symmetric, all  symmetric objects must remain symmetric throughout their evolution.  Most non-symmetric objects keep their non-symmetry as they evolve,  but some can become symmetric, especially if they result in a single  object. Here is a slightly more complicated example where two  gliders interact to form a blockade:  Many useful objects are symmetric along an orthogonal axis. This  commonly occurs by placing two copies of an object side by side to  change the behaviour of the objects due to the inhibition or killing  of new cells at their gutter interface. Examples of this are  twin bees shuttle, centinal, and the object shown in puffer.  Other useful symmetric objects are created by perturbing a symmetric  object using nearby oscillators or spaceships in a symmetric  manner. Examples of this are Schick engine, blinker ship, and  hivenudger.  Many spaceships found by search programs are symmetric because  the search space for such objects is much smaller than for  non-symmetrical spaceships. Examples include dart, 60P5H2V0, and  119P4H1V0.",

A second glider can  safely follow the first any time after 78 ticks, but overclocking  also allows the syringe to work at a repeat time of 74 or 75 ticks.  If followed by a dependent conduit a simple eater2 can be used  instead of the large welded catalyst shown here. A  ghost Herschel marks the output location.

The spark is very accessible and is able  to perturb many things.  The snakes can be replaced with eaters to form a slightly smaller  version, as shown in the p46 MWSS gun in gliderless  The period of this new oscillator is the same as the old  twin bees shuttle, and so this is able to expand the known p46  technology. For example, a p46 glider gun can be made from a  Tanner's p46 and just one of the twin bees shuttles.  Acting on their own, two copies of Tanner's p46 placed at right  angles to each other with their sparks interacting can produce two  different p46 glider guns and a gliderless p46 MWSS gun. See  p46 gun and gliderless for two of these. These are the first p46  guns found which do not use a twin bees shuttle at all.",

A toad can be used as a  90-degree one-time turner.  The protruding cells at the edges can perturb some reactions by  encouraging and then suppressing births on successive ticks. For  example, a toad can replace the northwest eater in the  Callahan G-to-H converter, allowing it to be packed one diagonal  cell closer to other circuits.",

In the figure above, glider B and an LWSS are about to send a glider  NW. Glider A will delete the next glider after B, turning off the  output stream. But if the device were already off, B wouldn't be  present and A would instead delete the leading LWSS, turning the  device back on.",

After passing through or past that  location, the same reaction then recreates the catalyst in exactly  its original position. This type of catalysis is surprisingly common  in signal circuitry. For an example, see  transparent block reaction.  The transparent object is most often a very common still life  such as a block or beehive. Rarer objects are not unknown; for  example, a transparent loaf was found by Stephen Silver in October  1997, in a very useful elementary conduit making up part of a  Herschel receiver. However, not surprisingly, rarer objects are  much less likely to reappear in exactly the correct location and  orientation, so transparent reactions involving them are much more  difficult to find, on average.",

For  example, the joining of a period 3 and a period 4 oscillator as  shown below creates a single object which is a trivial oscillator of  period 12.  However, there are trivial oscillators that meet this requirement,  but may still be considered to be non-trivial because the  different-period rotors are not separated by stator cells. An  example is Dean Hickerson's trivial p6. Conversely, there are  oscillators formed by trivial combinations of high-period guns or  sparkers that are only technically non-trivial, because the  lower-period components overlap but do not interact in any way.  \"Trivial\" is also used to describe a parent of an object which  has groups of cells that can be removed without changing the result,  such as isolated faraway cells. For example, here is a trivial  parent of a block.",

    "description": " An arrangement of four 90-degree reflectors that can  be placed into the path of a glider so as to delay it by an  adjustable number of generations, without changing its lane. More  generally, any combination of circuits may be referred to as a  trombone slide, if the grouping can be moved as a single unit that  functions as a 180-degree glider reflector.  The smallest known trombone slides are made using Snarks. In the  trombone slide shown below, sample input and output gliders are  shown. The input glider will reach the same output location 128  generations sooner if the trombone slide is removed.  If the top and left Snarks are moved together diagonally to the  upper left by N cells, then the glider delay is increased by 8N  generations since the glider has to travel N more cells in each  direction. This sliding action gives the trombone slide its name.  If only the final Snark is moved, then the output glider's path can  be altered by a number of full diagonals.  Trombone slides made of the same type of component cannot alter the  glider path by half-diagonals, and can only change the timing by  multiples of 8 generations. For other timing changes, different  components are necessary. These may be stable like the  Silver reflector or the colour-changing example shown in the  reflector article, or periodic like the various bumpers.",

The same distinction between  true and pseudo also exists for puffers. An easy way to check that  a gun is true period n is to stop the output with an eater, and  check that the result is a period-n oscillator.  True period n guns are known to exist for all periods greater than  61 (see My Experience with B-heptominos in Oscillators), but only a  few smaller periods have been achieved, namely 20, 22, 24, 30, 36,  40, 44, 45, 46, 48, 50, and 54 through 61.

The following small example is by Nicolay Beluchenko  (August 2005), using a quarter.  In October 2005, David Bell constructed an adjustable high-period  diagonal c/4 rake that burns tubstretcher wicks to create  gliders, which are then turned and duplicated by convoys of  diagonal c/4 spaceships to re-ignite the stabilized ends of the  same wicks.",

    "description": " A one-time glider reflector, or in other words a  single-glider seed (the term is seldom or never used in relation to  spaceships other than gliders). One-time turners may be 90-degree or  180-degree, or they may be 0-degree with the output in the same  direction as the input. A reusable turner would instead be called a  reflector. Shown on the top row below are the four 90-degree turner  reactions that use common small ash objects: boat, eater1,  long boat, and toad.  Of the reactions on the first row, the glider output is the same  parity for all but the long boat. The three still lifes are all  colour-changing, but the toad happens to be a colour-preserving  turner. The third row shows an aircraft carrier serving as a  \"0-degree turner\" that is also colour-changing.  Three of the simplest 180-degree turners are shown in the second  row. The Blockic 180-degree turner is colour-preserving. The  long boat and long ship are again colour-changing; this is  somewhat counterintuitive as the output glider is on exactly the same  lane as the input glider, but gliders travelling in opposite  directions on the same lane always have opposite colours.  Many small one-time turner constellations have also been  catalogued. The 90-degree two-block turner on the right, directly  below the toad, is also colour-changing but has the opposite parity.  A one-time turner reaction can be used as part of a glider  injection mechanism, or as a switching mechanism for a signal.  If a previous reaction has created the sacrificial object, then a  later glider is turned onto a new path. Otherwise it passes through  the area unaffected. This is one way to create simple switching  systems or logic circuits. An example is shown in demultiplexer.",

See new gun for an example.  There are numerous ways to stabilize the ends, two of which are shown  in the diagram. On the left is David Bell's double block reaction  (which results in a shorter, but wider, shuttle than usual), and on  the right is the stabilization by a single block. This latter method  produces the very large twin bees shuttle spark which is useful in  a number of ways. See metamorphosis for an example. Adding a  symmetrically placed block below this one suppresses the spark. See  also p54 shuttle.",

After 3 generations it becomes symmetric along the horizontal axis,  after 9 generations it becomes symmetric along the vertical axis  also, and finally dies after 18 generations.  Since the spark is isolated and long-lived, there are many possible  perturbations that it can perform. One of the most useful is  demonstrated in metamorphosis where a glider is converted into a  LWSS. Another useful one can turn a LWSS by 90 degrees:",

It is usual to use the prefix \"meta-\" for simulated Life features,  so, for example, for the first known unit Life cell (constructed by  David Bell in January 1996), one metatick is 5760 ticks, and one  metacell is 500x500 cells. Capital letters were originally used to  make this distinction - e.g., Generation, Cell - but this usage is no  longer common.

(The concept of computability can be defined in terms of  Turing machines, or by Church's lambda calculus, or by a number of  other methods, all of which can be shown to lead to equivalent  definitions.) The relevance of this to Life is that both Bill Gosper  and John Conway proved early on that it is possible to construct a  universal computer in the Life universe. (To prove the universality  of a cellular automaton with simple rules was in fact Conway's aim  in Life right from the start.) Conway's proof is outlined in  Winning Ways, and also in The Recursive Universe.  Until recently, no universal Life computer had ever been built in  practice In April 2000, Paul Rendell completed a Turing machine  construction (see http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm for details).  This, however, has a finite tape, as opposed to the infinite tape of  a true Turing machine, and is therefore not a universal computer.  But in November 2002, Paul Chapman announced the construction of a  universal computer, see  http://www.igblan.free-online.co.uk/igblan/ca/. This is a universal  register machine based around Dean Hickerson's  sliding block memory.  In 2009 Adam P. Goucher constructed a programmable Spartan  universal computer/constructor pattern using stable Herschel  circuitry. It included memory tapes and registers capable of holding  a simple universal instruction set and program data, and also a  minimal single-arm universal constructor. Its size meant that it  was extremely impractical to program it to be self-constructing,  though this was theoretically possible if the escape of large numbers  of gliders could be allowed as a side effect.  In February 2010, Paul Rendell completed a universal Turing machine  design with an unlimited tape, as described in his thesis at  http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/22323/1/thesis.pdf.  In 2016 Nicolas Loizeau (\"Coban\") completed a Life pattern  emulating a complete 8-bit programmable computer.  See also universal constructor.",

    "name": "universal constructor",
    "description": " A pattern that is capable of constructing  almost any pattern that has a glider synthesis. This definition is  a bit vague. A precise definition seems impossible because it is not  known, for example, whether all still lifes are constructible. In  any case, a universal constructor ought to be able to construct  itself in order to qualify as such.  An outline of Conway's proof that such a pattern exists can be  found in Winning Ways, and also in The Recursive Universe. The  key mechanism for the production of gliders with any given path and  timing is known as side-tracking, and is based on the  kickback reaction. A universal constructor designed in this way  can also function as a universal destructor: it can delete almost  any pattern that can be deleted by gliders.  In May 2004, Paul Chapman and Dave Greene produced a prototype  programmable universal constructor. This is able to construct  objects by means of slow glider constructions. It likely that it  could be programmed to construct itself, but the necessary program  would be very large; moreover an additional mechanism would be needed  in order to copy the program.  A universal constructor is theoretically most useful when attached  to a universal computer, which can be programmed to control the  constructor to produce the desired pattern of gliders. In what  follows I will assume that a universal constructor always includes  this computer.  The existence of a universal constructor/destructor has a number of  theoretical consequences.  For example, the constructor could be programmed to make copies of  itself. This is a replicator.  The constructor could even be programmed to make just one copy of  itself translated by a certain amount and then delete itself. This  would be a (very large, very high period) spaceship. Any  translation is possible, so that the spaceship could travel in any  direction. If the constructor makes a rotated but unreflected copy  of itself, the result would be a looping spaceship or  reflectorless rotating oscillator.  The constructor could also travel slower than any given speed,  since we could program it to perform some time-wasting task (such as  repeatedly constructing and deleting a block) before copying itself.  Of course, we could also choose for it to leave some debris behind,  thus making a puffer.  It is also possible to show that the existence of a universal  constructor implies the existence of a stable reflector. This  proof is not so easy, however, and is no longer of much significance  now that explicit examples of such reflectors are known.  Progressively smaller universal-constructor mechanisms without an  attached universal computer have been used in the  linear propagator, spiral growth pattern, and the Demonoids and  Orthogonoid. See also single-channel.  Another strange consequence of the existence of universal  constructors was pointed out by Adam P. Goucher and Tanner Jacobi in  2015. Any glider-constructible pattern, no matter how large, can be  constructed with a fixed number of gliders, by working out a  construction recipe for a universal constructor attached to a decoder  that measures the distance to a faraway object. The object's  position encodes a numeric value that can be processed to retrieve as  many bits of information as are needed to build a slow salvo to  construct any given target pattern. The simplest design, requiring  less than a hundred gliders, is described in reverse caber tosser.",

A stable universal regulator was constructed by  Dave Greene in September 2015, with a minimum delay between test  signals of 1177 ticks. Later stable versions have reduced the delay  to 952 ticks.  A universal regulator can allow two complex circuits to interact  safely, even if they have different base periods. For example,  signals from a stable logic circuit could be processed by a  period-30 mechanism, though the precise timing of those signals would  change in most cases.",

    "description": " The volatility of an oscillator is the size (in cells)  of its rotor divided by the sum of the sizes of its rotor and its  stator. In other words, it is the proportion of cells involved in  the oscillator which actually oscillate. For many periods there are  known oscillators with volatility 1, see for example Achim's p16,  figure-8, Kok's galaxy, mazing, pentadecathlon, phoenix,  relay, smiley and tumbler. Such an oscillator of period 3 was  found in August 2012 by Jason Summers.  The smallest period for which the existence of such statorless  oscillators is undecided is 7. There are oscillators with volatility  arbitrarily close to 1 for all but finitely many periods, because of  the possibility of feeding the gliders from a true period n gun  into an eater.  The term \"volatility\" is due to Robert Wainwright. See also  strict volatility.",

It is currently the fastest oblique macro-spaceship in Conway's Game  of Life by several orders of magnitude, and is also the smallest  known oblique macro-spaceship in terms of bounding box, superseding  the Parallel HBK. It is no longer the smallest or fastest oblique  spaceship due to the discovery in 2018 of the elementary  knightship Sir Robin.  Previous oblique spaceships, the Gemini and the  half-baked knightships, are stationary throughout almost all of  their life cycles, as they construct the necessary mechanisms to  support a sudden short move. The waterbear constructs support for  reburnable fuse reactions involving (23,5)c/79 Herschel climbers  that are in constant motion.",

Especially if the wave gets longer over time, the supporting  patterns are wavestretchers.  Also, the gliders or spaceships emitted by a rake may be referred  to as a wave, again because the line as a whole appears to move in a  different direction from the individual components, due to the rake's  movement. Compare with stream.  In general a wave can be interpreted as moving at a variety of  different velocities, depending on which specific subcomponents are  chosen as the starting and ending points for calculating speed and  direction. See antstretcher, wavestretcher for a practical  example of identical wave ends being connected to spaceships with  different velocities.",

Connecting the following to a standard diagonal antstretcher  creates a new oblique wavestretcher (a type of growing spaceship)  and also an alternate space nonfiller mechanism.  A required supporting c/5 spark is shown at the right edge. It can  be supplied by a spider or another c/5 orthogonal spaceship with a  similar edge spark. Alternatively, the c/5 component could  theoretically be replaced by a supporting spaceship travelling  diagonally at c/6, to support the same oblique trail of ants. As of  June 2018 no workable c/6 component has been found.",

This is shown  below with an improved back end found by Hickerson the following  month.  Diagonally moving c/4 and c/12 wickstretchers have also been built:  see tubstretcher and linestretcher. In July 2000 Jason Summers  constructed a c/2 wickstretcher, stretching a p50 traffic jam wick,  based on an earlier (October 1994) pattern by Hickerson. A c/5  diagonal wickstretcher was found in January 2011 by Matthias  Merzenich, who also discovered a c/5 orthogonal wickstretcher two  years later in March 2013.",

If N is not specified it is generally taken to be one, in which  case the zone of influence simply coincides with the Moore  neighbourhood of the cell or pattern.  The set for N generations consists of all the cells to which at  least N paths of length N can be traced from the cell(s) in question.  Contrast this with the range-N Moore neighbourhood, which consists of  all cells to which at least one path of length n can be traced."
